[[BASE_ENV]]
Before you can start developing _WSJT_ applications, you must first 
set up your environment. The {page} environment will use the
respective *JTSDK* for Windows and *WSJT-ENV* for Linux as the
containment area for all activity.

.The containment area will provide:
* A fixed structure to work from
* Isolated build tools
* Produce repeatable results from application builds
* Create an experimental area to test installations
* Minimize the footprint v.s. Virtual Environments
* Provide a simply environment for non-developers to build and test

Software development kits are provided for Windows and Linux. The kits
setup the environment described above. Details of each kit can be found
at the end of the dev-guide. The kits are described as follows:

.JTSDK-DOC
* Provides applications and scripts to build all _WSJT_ documentation.

.JTSDK-PY
* Provides applications and scripts to build *Python* based _WSJT_
and _WSPR_.

.JTSDK-QT
* Provides applications and scripts to build *QT5* based _WSJT-X_,
_WSPR-X_ and  _MAP65_.

.JTSDK-NIX
* Provides QT5, Python3 ({plus} modules) and all required support
dependencies.

TIP: Each kit is self contained, meaning, you should not have to install
any software on the host system in order to build applications or
documentation.

[[PATHCFG]]
=== Path Configuration 

The {page} will use the respective SDK, and thus the following
paths throughout:

* +*WINDOWS*+
- Scripts, builds and package installations will be in:
- C:\JTSDK-DOC
- C:\JTSDK-PY
- C:\JTSDK-QT

//	

* +*LINUX*+
- JTSDK-NIX
- /opt/jtsdk-nix

// 

- Scripts, builds and package installations will be in:
- /home/$USER/wsjt-env


IMPORTANT: If you choose to install an SDK in a different location
from the recommendation, you will need to reconfigure it, basically
rebuild the SDK from scratch in order to maintain the proper relatave
paths.

[[WINBASESETUP]]
== Windows SDK

Setup and installation is straight forward. The .EXE files are self
extracting 7z compressed files. We will use +*JTSDK-DOC*+ as the
example, but all three SDKs use the exact same process.

=== Download

Download one or all of the following:

[horizontal]
+*JTSDK-DOC*+:: {jtsdk_doc}
+*JTSDK-PY*+:: {jtsdk_py}
+*JTSDK-QT*+:: {jtsdk_qt}

=== Installation
* Double Click or Right Click and Open the download
* Change path to: C:\
* Click the Extract Button

image::images/7z-extract.png[]

* Browse to C:\JTSDK-*
* Open the env batch file
** For JTSDK-DOC, +*jtsdk-docenv.bat*+
** For JTSDK-PY, +*jtsdk-pyenv.bat*+
** For JTSDK-QT, +*jtsdk-qtenv.bat*+
* Follow the instructions for SVN checkout

=== Uninstall
* Delete C:\JTSDK-DOC -PY or -QT
* Nothing is installed to the system or registry

=== JTSDK-DOC

+*JTSDK-DOC*+ is a collection of applications and scripts used to build
all +*WSJT*+ documentation. Detailed information is provided in
<<JTSDKDOC,JTSDK-DOC>>.
