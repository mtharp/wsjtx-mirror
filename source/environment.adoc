[[BASE_ENV]]
Before you can start developing _WSJT_ applications, you must first 
set up your environment. The {page} environment will use the
respective *JTSDK* for Windows and *WSJT-ENV* for Linux as the
containment area for all activity. Reason(s) for this containment are:

* Establish a fixed structure to work from
* Use the same tools across all applications
* Isolate the build tools from system installations
* Produce repeatable results from application builds
* Create an experimental area to test installation configurations
* Minimize the installation footprint and complexity v.s. Virtual Environments
* Provide a functional environment for non-developers to build and test

=== Language {amp} Terms

The following language is used throughout the {page}

[horizontal]
+*JTSDK*+:: Software Development Kit
+*JTSDK Env*+:: Isolated Build Environment
+*CMD Terminal+*:: Standard Windows Command Terminal
+*Build Script*+:: Batch or Shell Script used to build applications
+*Tool Chain File*+:: CMake configuration file used by build scripts
+*X-Term+*:: X-Terminal for Linux, BSD and OS X

[[PATHCFG]]
=== Path Configuration 

The {page} will use the following configuration throughout:

* +*WINDOWS*+
- All scripts, builds and package installations will be in:
- C:\JTSDK-DOC
- C:\JTSDK-PY
- C:\JTSDK-QT
//	
* +*LINUX*+
- All scripts, builds and package installations will be in:
- /home/$USER/wsjt-env

IMPORTANT: If you choose to install the JTSDKs in a different location
from the recommendation, you will need to reconfigure, basically rebuild,
the SDK from scratch in order for the builds to be successful.

[[WINBASESETUP]]
== Windows

Setup and installation is straight forward. The .EXE files are self
extracting 7z compressed files. We will use +*JTSDK-DOC*+ as the
example, but all three SDKs use the exact same process.

=== SDK Download

Download one or all of the following:

[horizontal]
+*JTSDK-DOC*+:: {jtsdk_doc}
+*JTSDK-PY*+:: {jtsdk_py}
+*JTSDK-QT*+:: {jtsdk_qt}

=== Installation
* Double Click or Right Click and Open the download
* Change path to: C:\
* Click the Extract Button

image::images/7z-extract.png[]

* Browse to C:\JTSDK-*
* Open the env batch file
** For JTSDK-DOC, +*jtsdk-docenv.bat*+
** For JTSDK-PY, +*jtsdk-pyenv.bat*+
** For JTSDK-QT, +*jtsdk-qtenv.bat*+
* Follow the instructions for SVN checkout

=== Uninstall
* Delete C:\JTSDK-DOC -PY or -QT
* Nothing is installed to the system or registry
