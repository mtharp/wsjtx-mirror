[[BASE_ENV]]
Before you can start developing _WSJT_ applications, you must first 
set up your environment. The _{page}_ environment will use the
respective +*JTSDK*+ for Windows and +*WSJT-ENV*+ FOr Linux as the
containment area for all activity. Reason(s) for this containment are:

* Establish a fixed structure to work from
* Use the same tools across all applications
* Isolate the build tools from system installations
* Produce repeatable results from application builds
* Create an experimental area to test installation configurations
* Minimize the installation footprint and complexity v.s. Virtual Environments
* Provide a functional environment for non-developers to build and test

=== Language {amp} Terms

The following language is used throughout the {page}

[horizontal]
+*JTSDK*+:: Software Development Kit
+*JTSDK Env*+:: Isolated Build Environment
+*CMD Terminal+*:: Standard Windows Command Terminal
+*Build Script*+:: Batch or Shell Script used to build applications
+*Tool Chain File*+:: CMake configuration file used by build scripts
+*X-Term+*:: X-Terminal for Linux, BSD and OS X

[[PATHCFG]]
=== Path Configuration 

The _{page}_  will use the following configuration throughout:

* +*WINDOWS*+
- All scripts, builds and package installations will be in:
- C:\JTSDK-DOC
- C:\JTSDK-PY
- C:\JTSDK-QT
//	
* +*LINUX*+
- - All scripts, builds and package installations will be in:
- /home/$USER/wsjt-env

IMPORTANT: If you choose to install the JTSDKs in a different location
from the recommendation, you will need to reconfigure, basically rebuild,
the SDK from scratch in order for the builds to be successful.

[[WINBASESETUP]]
=== Windows Base Setup

Setup and installation is straight forward. The .EXE files are self
extracting 7z compressed files. Download the following:

We will use +*JTSDK-DOC*+ as the example, but all three SDKs use the
exact same process.
.Download
* +*JTSDK-DOC*+ .. {jtsdk_doc}
* +*JTSDK-PY*+ ... {jtsdk_py}
* +*JTSDK-QT*+ ... {jtsdk_qt}

.Install SDK
* Double Click or Right Click and Open the download
* Change path to: C:\

image::images/7z-extract.png[]

* Browse to C:\JTSDK-DOC
* Open the batch called +*jtsdk-docenv.bat*+
* Follow the instructions fo checkout from SVN.

.Removal / Uninstall
* Delete C:\JTSDK-DOC 
* Nothing is installed to the system or registry

[[LINBASESETUP]]
=== Linux Base Setup
Most Linux distributions have Subversion in their repositories. If SVN is
already installed, ensure you can use it via X-Term with: svn --version,
otherwise continue with setup:

* Open X-Term Window

----------
# DEBIAN, UBUNTU, MINT and FRIENDS

sudo apt-get install subversion

# CHECK SVN IS FUNCTIONAL

svn --version

# SUCESSFUL RETURN - Note: Versions may very slightly

svn, 1.7.14

# EXIT X-TERM
----------
