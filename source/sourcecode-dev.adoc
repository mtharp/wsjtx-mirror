All source code for the WSJT programs is available at the open-source
repository known as {berlios1}, under control of the version-control
program {svn}.  You can install Subversion in Windows from the above
link; in Linux use

---------
sudo apt-get install subversion 
---------

or an equivalent command for your Linux distribution.  

You can browse the organization of files in the repository {wsjt_svn}.
Code for program _WSJT_ lies in the +trunk+ directory, while code for
the other programs is found in +.../branches/map65+,
+.../branches/wsjtx+, and +.../branches/wsprx+.  Various experimental
branches may also exist, and snapshots of code for certain released
program versions may be obtained from the +.../tags+ directory.

You can do an anonymous checkout of source code for a specific program
with a command of the following form:

---------
svn co svn://svn.berlios.de/wsjt/branches/wsjtx 
---------

If you are a member of the WSJT Development Group and have commit privileges
to the repository, use a command like this one:

---------
svn co https://user@svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/wsjt/branches/wsjtx
---------

substituting your Berlios username for +user+.

CAUTION: Please note: the HEAD of the SVN repository for any of these
programs is likely to be an active development branch.  There is no
guarantee that a build from every revision will be successful, nor
that it will provide a stable executable program.
