:prog: The WSJT Developers Guide

=== Windows CMake

The preferred method of compiling _MAP65_ on Windows is using *JTSDK-QT*.
If you have not *Installed and Updated* *JTSDK-QT*, you should do so before
continuing, see <<WININSTALL,Windows Install>> and <<WINUPDATE,Update>>

WARNING: As of this writing, the CMake build method is being updated to
bring it more in-line with _MAP65_ builds. Expect build anomalies
until this method has been stabilized.

[[WSJTCOMPILEOPTIONS]]
.COMPILING OPTIONS
Using *JTSDK-QT* for compiling _MAP65_, you can build two versions:

* <<MAP65COMPILE,Debug>>
* <<MAP65COMPILE,Release>>

The CMake process for _MAP65_ is not as sophisticated as that of _WSJT-X_.
The process still uses *Debug* and *Release*, but the build times and
final configuration are similar with the exception of adding Qt Debug
capabilities. The default build is *Debug*. To build the *Release*
version, use the *( -r )* flag.

[[MAP65COMPILE]]

.COMPILE MAP65

* Open Windows CMD terminal, at the prompt, type,:
----
C:\JTSDK-QT\jtsdk-qtenv.bat
----
* You should be presented with <<QTMENU,Figure-3>>
* At the Prompt, type,:
----

*For Debug*

build map65

*For Release*

build map65 -r

Note the ( -r for Release )

----
* If you have not checked out _MAP65_ previously, you will be prompted
to do so:

.MAP65 Checkout Not Found
image::images/jtsdk-map65-co.png[]

* Follow the prompts, Anonymous or Developer, then type,:
-----

*For Debug*

build map65

*For Release*

build map65 -r

Note the ( -r for Release )

-----

TIP: If this is a subsequent build, you will be asked to update from SVN.
On a new checkout, select ( N for do not update), if not new, it is 
your choice. If the SVN update fails, for whatever reason, or there are errors
during the build, simply re-run the build, as sometimes Windows reacts
faster than SVN can respond, or there is an SVN comms error.

* At build completion, you are presented with an option to
run +*MAP65*+ now. Select ( Y to Run / N to Finish and Exit).
* To manually run the newly built +*map65.exe*+, browse to:
----

*For Release*
C:\JTSDK-QT\map65\install\Release\bin

*For Debug*
C:\JTSDK-QT\map65\install\Debug\bin

----
* Double click on +*map65.exe*+
* At this time, _MAP65_ does not need the environment batch file to run
in *Debug* mode. This will change as development of the CMake method
progresses.
