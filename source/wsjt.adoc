The preferred method of compiling _WSJT_ on Windows is using JTSDK-PY.
If you have not *Installed and Updated* JTSDK-PY, you should do so before
continuing, see <<WININSTALL,Windows Install>> and <<WINUPDATE,Updates>>

TIP: You can create a desktop shortcut to +*jtsdk-pyenv.bat*+ if
desired. This can also be done for the final +*wsjt.exe*+.
