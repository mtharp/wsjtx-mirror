== Overview

The WSJT family of programs for weak-signal amateur radio
communication includes _WSJT_, _WSPR_, _MAP65_, _WSJT-X_, and
_WSPR-X_.  User interfaces for _WSJT_ and _WSPR_ are written in
Python, and build procedures for these two programs are similar.  User
interfaces for _MAP65_, _WSJT-X_, and _WSPR-X_ are written in C++ and
use the Qt framework, and they share most build procedures.  Most
number-crunching in all of the _WSJT_ programs is done in Fortran.

Communications should be moved to a global file to prevent rework / repeat in the
