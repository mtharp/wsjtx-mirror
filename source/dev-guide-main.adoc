== Overview

The WSJT family of programs for weak-signal amateur radio
communication includes _WSJT_, _WSPR_, _MAP65_, _WSJT-X_, and
_WSPR-X_.  User interfaces for _WSJT_ and _WSPR_ are written in
Python, and build procedures for these two programs are similar.  User
interfaces for _MAP65_, _WSJT-X_, and _WSPR-X_ are written in C++ and
use the Qt framework, and they share most build procedures.  Most
number-crunching in all of the _WSJT_ programs is done in Fortran.

The {page} is a work in progress.  Instructions for the Python-based programs
are still to come, but we do currently provide instructions for compiling
_WSJT-X_ in Linux and we outline the prerequisites for compiling it in Windows.
Similar procedures to these can be used for building _MAP65_ and _WSPR-X_.
