== Overview

The WSJT family of programs for weak-signal amateur radio
communication includes _WSJT_, _WSPR_, _MAP65_, _WSJT-X_, and
_WSPR-X_.  User interfaces for _WSJT_ and _WSPR_ are written in
Python. User interfaces for _MAP65_, _WSJT-X_, and _WSPR-X_ are
written in C++ and use the Qt5 framework. The build process, when 
the JTSDK(s), is similar for all 5 applications. Most number-crunching
in all of the _WSJT_ programs is done in Fortran.
