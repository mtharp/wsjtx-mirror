This is where binaries of kvasd can be found.

The directories Windows,  Linux, Darwin are used by  older versions of
WSJT-X builds and only need to contain kvasd v1.11.

The directories in the format  `uname -s`-`uname -p` are more specific
and cover  architectures as well  as platforms. These must  contain at
least kvasd v1.12 binaries since features of it are required by WSJT-X
at least.

Each v1.12 binary called kvasd or  kvasd.exe must sit alongside an MD5
checksum file named kvasd.md5 or kvasd.exe.md5 respectively.

For the Darwin versions,  the executables  SHALL BE PREPROCESSED using 
install_name_tool  to  reference  all  dylibs  using  the  psuedo path 
'@executable_path/' so they are suitable for inclusion into the WSJT-X 
application bundle in the path  ../Contents/MacOS/  which is where the 
libgcc support dylibs reside.
