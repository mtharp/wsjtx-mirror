Decoder for RS(63,12)_6.

== SYNOPSIS

it cannot be included with most Linux distributions. KVASD-Installer

== PROGRAMS

*KVASD-Installer* provides (3) primary functions:

'INSTALL' - To install the KVASD decoder, select install from the main menu.
If you have not done so already, you will be asked to agree to the End User
License Agreement ( EULA ). If you do not < Accept > the ( EULA ), the script
will display a message, and return you to the main menu.

After reading and accepting the ( EULA ), the script with look for KVASD
first in /usr/bin, if not found, it will download the latest version from SVN.
If it is found, it will run a few simple tests to verify its functionality.

  'NOTE': - You should NOT run this script as Root, or Sudo, as it writes tmp
            files to the user directory. The only action that requires Root or
            Sudo is the actual installing of the binary, at which time you will
            be prompted for your Root / Sudo password.

'REMOVE' - To remove KVASD, select Remove from the Main Menu. This only removes
the KVASD binary. If you want to remove the kvasd-installer package, use
your package manager:

.........
sudo apt-get remove kvasd-installer
.........

'TEST DECODER' - Test decoder runs a few very simple tests to ensure it is
functional on the system. If you installed kvasd-installer from either a PPA
or your distribution package manager, all the required dependencies should
be revolved for you.
 
The Following Tests Will Be Run:
* Base path test to ensure KVASD is installed to /usr/bin
* Version test to ensure KVASD can render the version number
* LDD test to verify all the required libs are installed
