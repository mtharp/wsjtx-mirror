primary functions:

*INSTALL* - To install the KVASD decoder, select Install from the main menu.
If you have not done so already, you will be asked to agree to the End User
License Agreement ( EULA ). If you do not < Accept > the EULA, the script
will display a message, retun you to the main menu.
 
 *NOTE* - Although the binary is free to use in Ham Radio, the user must accept
          the terms laid out in the EULA before the script will install the binary.
 
After reading and accepting the ( EULA ), the script with look for KVASD
first in /usr/bin, if not found, it will download the latest version from SVN.
If it is found, it will run a few simple tests to verify its functionality.

will go through a series of tests, and eventually install KVASD in the
system folder /usr/bin

           files to the user directory. The only action that requires Root or

           be prompted for your Root / Sudo password.


*REMOVE* - To remove KVASD, select Remove from the Main Menu. This only removes
the KVASD binary. If you want to remove WSJT-KVASD ( the package ),

Or to purge all files, including the KVASD binary:

sudo apt-get purge kvasd-installer
.........


*TEST DECODER* - Test runs a few very simple tests to ensure it is functional
on the system. If you installed WSJT-KVASD from either a PPA or your
distribution package manager, all the required dependencies should be revolved
for you.
 
The Following Tests Will Be Run:
* Base path test to ensure KVASD is installed to /usr/bin
