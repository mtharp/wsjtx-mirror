NSIS Addons
===========

This directory contains archives of NSIS plugins and includes that are
used in making the WSJT-X Windows  installer. The plugin DLLs are also
extracted and deployed in sub-directories  where they are added to the
project  NSIS plugin  path in  the project  CMakeCPackOptions.cmake.in
template which is in turn used in generating the NSIS installer script
from the CMake/Modules/NSIS.template.in template file.
