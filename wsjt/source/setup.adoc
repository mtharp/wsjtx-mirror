=== Options
- Start _WSJT_ and select *Options* from the *Setup* menu.  Enter
the following information:

* *My Call*: <Your Call Sign>

* *Grid Locator*: <Your 6-digit Maidenhead locator>

* *ID Interval*: set the time interval for sending your CW identification. 
Zero (0) means never.

* *PTT port*: if you will use RTS or DTR for T/R control, choose a
serial port.  On Windows enter the number of the port (for example 1
if you will use COM1).  Enter 0 if you will use VOX control (not
recommended if you will be running high power).  On Linux or FreeBSD
enter the actual device name, for example +/dev/ttyS0+.

* *PTT Line*: choose *DTR* or *RTS*.

* *Distance unit*: choose miles or kilometers.

- The console window (with black background) presents a list of the
audio devices available on your system.  On the *Options* screen, set
*Audio In* to the number of the desired input device and *Audio Out*
to the number of the output device.  The chosen devices must offer at
least two input or output channels.  For example, Audio devices
number 1 (input) and 4 (output) could be selected from the following
screen image.  Your selections will take effect the next time you start
the program.

- Take note of two numbers in the first panel of the status bar at
lower left of the main screen.  After _WSJT_ has been running for a
minute or so they should stabilize at values close to 1.0000.  If both
numbers are between 0.9995 and 1.0005, the effective input and output
sampling rates of your soundcard are close to the nominal 11025 Hz.
If either number is outside this range, enter it as *Rate in* (first
number) or *Rate out* (second number) on the *Setup | Options* screen.
_WSJT_ will then make necessary adjustments for the incorrect sampling
rate or rates.

[[FONTS]]
=== Fonts

You can control the fonts and colors used in _WSJT_.  A text file
named +wsjtrc.win+ (on Windows) or +wsjtrc+ (on Linux and FreeBSD) is
supplied with the following contents:

 *font:				Arial 8
 *Label*font:			Arial 8
 *Text*font:			"Courier New" 9
 *background:			gray85
 *Text*background:		white
 *Entry*background:		white
 *foreground:			black
 *Listbox*foreground:	        RoyalBlue

You can edit this file with a text editor (such as Windows Notepad).
For example, to make the on-screen fonts slightly larger you can
increase the numbers on the first three lines to 9, 9, and 10.  It
might be wise to save a backup of the original file under a different
name, in case you need to restore the original contents.
