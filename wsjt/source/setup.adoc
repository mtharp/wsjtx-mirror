- To start WSJT on Windows, double-click on the desktop icon. On Linux
or FreeBSD, type +python -O wsjt.py+ at the command prompt.  Three
windows should appear on your screen.  For now, focus your attention
on the main window labeled *WSJT 9.7*.

- Select Options from the Setup menu.  Enter your callsign and grid
locator.  In the box labeled PTT Port, on Windows enter the number of
the serial port you will use for T/R control (for example 1 if you
will use COM1).  Enter 0 if you will use VOX control (not recommended
if you are running high power).  On Linux or FreeBSD enter the actual
device name, for example /dev/ttyS0.

- Dismiss the Options window, hit function key F7 to choose FSK441A
mode, and select Open from the File menu.  Navigate to the
RxWav\Samples folder in your WSJT home directory and open the file
recorded from W8WN.  When this file has been decoded, your main screen
should look something like the picture on page 4.  Try clicking with
the right mouse button around the location of the ping at t = 18 s on
the graphical display, and observe the decoded text that appears.  If
you click on the static crashes around t = 1 s or elsewhere on the
green line, you will see garbage text.  Click Erase to clear the text
and graphical areas.  You can click Decode to decode the full file
again.

- Take note of two numbers in the first panel of the status bar at
lower left of the main screen.  After WSJT has been running for a
minute or so they should stabilize at values close to 1.0000.  If both
numbers are between 0.9995 and 1.0005, the input and output sampling
rates of your soundcard are close to the nominal 11025 Hz.  If either
number is outside this range, enter it as Rate in (first number) or
Rate out (second number) on the Options screen.  WSJT will then make
necessary adjustments for the incorrect hardware sampling rate or
rates.

- You will need a method of setting your computer clock to an accuracy
of one second or better, and keeping it set.  Many operators use an
internet-based clock-setting program, while others use a broadcast
service such as GPS or WWVB.

.Adjusting Signal Levels

- If your computer has more than one sound card, select the desired
device numbers for Audio In and Audio Out.  The Console Window (see
picture on page 17) offers a menu of choices.

- Turn on your radio and tune it to a clear frequency so that only
background noise is sent to the sound card.

- Click Monitor to start audio sampling.

- Select Options | Rx volume control on the SpecJT screen to bring up
the sound card input mixer.

- Adjust a slider on the audio mixer and/or your receiver gain
control(s) to bring the signal level close to what WSJT considers ``0
dB'' as indicated on the bar graph at lower right of the SpecJT screen.
The signal level is also displayed on the status bar at bottom of the
main WSJT window.

- Press F7 to enter FSK441A mode.

- Select Options | Tx volume control to bring up the sound card output mixer.

- Click the Tx1 button to be sure that T/R switching works and that
audio tones are being sent from the computer to your radio.

- Adjust the slider on the audio mixer to get the proper audio signal
level for your transmitter.

.Amplifier Considerations

WSJT generates a single-frequency sine wave at any instant while
transmitting.  Except during station identification, there is no ``key
up'' time; signal amplitude is constant, and one tone changes to the
next one in a phase-continuous manner.  As a result, WSJT does not
require a high degree of linearity in your power amplifier. You can
use a class C amplifier without generating unwanted sidebands or
splatter.  Full amplitude transmissions lasting 30 seconds or longer
will put more stress on your final amplifier than SSB or CW operation.
If this would cause the amplifier to overheat, you should take
appropriate action: reduce power or add another cooling fan or blower.

WSJT should now be set up and ready to operate.  Be aware, however,
that WSJT is a complicated program.  It has many operational nuances,
especially ones having to do with the correct decoding of received
signals.  If you are a new WSJT user, it is strongly recommended that
you work through the decoding tutorial in the next section.
