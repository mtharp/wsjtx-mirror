A Developer's Guide for WSJT and its sister programs is in the works.
The {dev-guide} contains full instructions for compiling
_WSJT-X_ in Linux, and an outline of steps required in Windows.  The
_WSJT_ user interface is programmed in Python (rather than Qt), so the
required tools are somewhat different.  _WSJT_ can be built and used
successfully on Windows, Linux, OS X, FreeBSD.  Instructions will be
added here when time permits.
