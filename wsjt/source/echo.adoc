Echo mode allows you to make sensitive measurements of your own echoes
from the moon, even when they are too weak to be heard.  Select *Echo*
from the *Mode* menu, aim your antenna at the moon, pick a clear
frequency, and toggle the *Auto ON*.  _WSJT_ will then cycle through
the following loop every 6 seconds:

1. Transmit a fixed tone for 2.0 s 
2. Wait about 0.5 s for start of return echo 
3. Record the received signal for 2.0 s 
4. Analyze, average, and display the results 
5. Repeat from step 1 

At the start of each transmission the frequency of the transmitted
tone can be offset randomly around a nominal value of 1500 Hz. A
number in the entry field *Dither* (under *Miscellaneous* on 
the *Setup | Options* screen) controls the magnitude of the random
offset. The observed spectrum of each echo is shifted by the *Dither*
amount before being accumulated into the average. (This procedure is
very effective in minimizing the impact of birdies in the receiver
passband. In the average spectrum, a fixed-frequency birdie is smeared
out over a frequency range equal to the *Dither* value. For an example
see the screen shot below: the red curve is the corrected echo
spectrum, while the blue curve is the raw (uncorrected) data.

Information displayed in the main text box gives the number *N* of
completed echo cycles, the average Level of receiver background noise
in dB, the average echo strength *Sig* in dB, its measured frequency
offset *DF* in Hz (after correction for Doppler shift), spectral
*Width* of the echo in Hz, and a relative quality indicator *Q* on a
0-10 scale. Background noise level is given with respect to the
nominal 0 dB level used for all _WSJT_ modes. Signal strength is
measured in dB relative to the noise power in a 2500 Hz passband. Low
numbers for *Q* mean that an echo has not been detected, or is
unreliable; for *Q*=0 the values of *DF* and *Width* are meaningless,
and *Sig* may be considered an upper limit. Larger values of *Q* imply
increasingly believable echo measurements. If you can hear your own
lunar echoes, you will see reliable echo numbers within a few seconds
after toggling *Auto ON*. If your echoes are 15 to 20 dB below the
audible threshold you should get significant results within a minute
or so.
