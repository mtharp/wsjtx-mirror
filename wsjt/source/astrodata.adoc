In JT65 and JT4 modes a small blue-background text box presents data
for tracking the moon, tuning your receiver, and estimating EME path
degradation.  You may select menu item *View | Astronomical data* to
see more such data in a separate window, as shown below.

Available information includes azimuth and elevation (*Az* and *El*)
for the Moon, the Sun, and another astronomical source of your choice.
The right ascension (*RA*) and declination (*DEC*) for the additional
astronomical source should be entered on the *Setup | Options* screen
in the formats hh:mm:ss and dd.dd.  *Az* and *El* of the Moon are
given for the location of the DX station, as well as for the home
station.  *Doppler* shift (in Hz) and the rate of change of Doppler
shift, *df/dt*, in Hz/minute, are listed for two-way transmissions to
and from the DX station and for self-echoes from the home
station. *RA* and *DEC* are given for the moon.  All on-screen
coordinates are in degrees except for *RA*, which is in hours and
minutes.  *Tsky* gives the approximate galactic background temperature
in the direction of the moon, scaled to the operating frequency
*Freq*; *MNR* is the maximum non-reciprocity of the EME path in dB,
owing to spatial polarization; *Dpol* is the spatial polarization
offset, in degrees; *Dgrd* is an estimate of the total signal
degradation in dB, relative to the best possible time when the moon is
at perigee and in a cold part of the sky; and *SD* is the moon's
semi-diameter in arc minutes.
