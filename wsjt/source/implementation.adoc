JT65 and JT4 offer a number of submodes with different spacings
between tone frequencies.  JT65A, with 2.69 Hz spacinf, is generally
used at 50 MHz and below.  JT65B (5.38 Hz) is used on 144 and 432 MHz,
and JT65C (10.77 Hz) on 1296 MHz.  The B and C submodes are slightly
less sensitive than mode A, but progressively more tolerant of
frequency drifts and Doppler spread.  In a similar way, JT4 submodes A
through G offer tone spacings between 4.375 Hz and 315 Hz.  See the
<<PROTOCOLS,Protocol Specifications>> section, especially
<<SLOW_TAB,Table 2>>, for details.

The JT65 and JT4 decoders use a multi-layered procedure.  If the fully
general decoder fails, a deeper search can be made using a
matched-filter approach.  The *Deep Search* decoder constructs a list
of hypothetical messages by pairing each entry in the callsign
database with CQ and with the home callsign of the user.  Each trial
message is encoded as it would be done at the transmitter, including
all of the forward error-control (FEC) symbols.  The resulting
patterns are then tested for good match with the received wave file.
Even a single-character mismatch will prevent a decoding from being
achieved. You can define the list of likely callsigns in any way you
choose.  A default callsign database named +CALL3.TXT+ is provided
with _WSJT_, containing the calls of over 4800 stations known to have
been active in weak-signal work on the VHF/UHF bands.  If you use the
Deep Search decoder, keep your callsign list up to date and adapt it
to your own requirements.

In addition to *DT* and *DF*, decoded text lines provide information
on the relative strength of synchronization, the average
signal-to-noise ratio in dB relative to the noise power in 2500 Hz
bandwidth, and *W*, the measured frequency width of the sync signal,
in Hz.  A symbol following *W* indicates that an adequate level of
synchronization has been achieved: +*+ will be displayed for a normal
message, and +#+ for a message including the OOO signal report.  Two
numbers appear at the end of each line.  The first tells whether the
generalized soft-decision decoder succeeded (1) or failed (0).  The
second number gives a relative confidence level on a 0 to 10 scale for
results produced by the Deep Search decoder.  Shorthand messages do
not produce these numbers.

If a JT65 or JT4 transmission synchronizes correctly, its spectral
information is added into an accumulating array.  Spectra from
subsequent transmissions added into this array can make it possible to
decode the average, even if individual transmissions were not
decodable.  Results of such decoding attempts appear in the *Average
Text* window.

The *Deep Search* decoder necessarily has a gray area in which it
finds a probable solution but may have only moderate confidence in it.
In such cases the decoder appends a ? to the decoded text, and the
operator must make the final decision as to whether the decoding is
believable.  Be aware that because of the mathematical message
structure, incorrect decodings will not differ from the correct one in
only a few characters; more likely, they will contain wholly incorrect
callsigns and grid locators.  As you gain experience in recognizing
the graphical and numerical indications of proper message
synchronization (*Sync*, *dB*, *DT*, *DF*, *W*, and the green, red,
and blue curves in the graphical area), as well as the effects of
birdies and other interference, you will become adept at recognizing
and rejecting the occasional false decodes.  If it appears that an
unexpected (and perhaps exotic) station is calling you, treat it with
suspicion until you decode the message again in a subsequent
transmission.  Random decoding errors will seldom repeat themselves.

Several options are available for adjusting the JT65 decoding
procedure to your liking.  If you check *Decode | JT65 | Only EME
calls*, only a subset of callsigns in the database that include an
EME flag will be used in the Deep Search procedure.  Check *No
Shorthands if Tx 1* if you wish to suppress shorthand decodings when
you are still transmitting the first Tx message.  The *Decode | JT65*
sub-menu offers four options for the Deep Search decoder.  The first,
*No Deep Search*, disables it entirely.  *Normal Deep Search* turns it
on but suppresses output with confidence levels less than 3, and
*Aggressive Deep Search* allows output down to level 1.  The last
option, *Include Average in Aggressive Deep Search*, applies the Deep
Search procedure to the accumulating average as well as the most
recently received data. 

JT65 shorthand messages are powerful because they can be decoded at
signal levels about 5 dB below those required for standard messages.
They can also be decoded by ear, or by eye directly from the SpecJT
waterfall display.  If a message starts with RO, RRR, or 73 followed
by one or more spaces, the shorthand format will be sent.  If the
message satisfies the requirements for a structured message, the
specified callsigns, CQ, QRZ, locator, report and/or prefix/suffix
will be encoded and sent as entered.  With any other entry, 13
characters of arbitrary text will be encoded and sent.  The actual
message being transmitted is always displayed in the bottom right
corner of the main screen.  Yellow highlighting indicates a standard
message, blue a shorthand message, and red a plain text message.
