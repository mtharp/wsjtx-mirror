You are offered some control over the fonts and colors used in _WSJT_.
A text file named wsjtrc.win (on Windows) or wsjtrc (on Linux and
FreeBSD) is supplied with the following contents:

 *font:				Arial 8
 *Label*font:			Arial 8
 *Text*font:			"Courier New" 9
 *background:			gray85
 *Text*background:		white
 *Entry*background:		white
 *foreground:			black
 *Listbox*foreground:	        RoyalBlue

You can edit this file with a text editor (such as Windows Notepad).
For example, to make the on-screen fonts slightly larger you can
increase the numbers on the first three lines to 9, 9, and 10.  It
might be wise to save a backup of the original file under a different
name, in case you need to restore the original contents.
