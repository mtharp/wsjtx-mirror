A large part of the skill required for effective use of WSJT is
learning to use the decoders effectively.  To use the following
tutorial you must first obtain the collection of sample wave files
available at
http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT6_Samples.EXE (Windows)
or http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT6_Samples.tgz (Linux).
These files contain on-the-air recordings of meteor pings in FSK441
mode, pings and ionospheric scatter signals in JT6M mode, and EME
signals in the JT65 modes.  The package of sample files is about 22 MB
in size.  If you do not have a fast internet connection, you may wish
to obtain the sample wave files on CD-ROM.  Instructions may be found
at http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/Download.htm.

. If you have already installed and used a version of WSJT6, delete
your WSJT.INI file or temporarily rename it to something else. This
will ensure that you start the tutorial with everything in the default
configuration.

. Install the sample files to the RxWav subdirectory under your WSJT6
installation directory.  You can do this by executing the file
WSJT6_Samples.EXE (in Windows) or by extracting the tarfile
WSJT6_Samples.tgz (in Linux or FreeBSD).

. Double-click on the WSJT6 desktop icon to start the program in
Windows.  In Linux, start the program by typing python -O wsjt.py.
Position the main WSJT6 window conveniently on your screen.  You may
ignore or minimize the other two windows for now.

. By default WSJT starts in FSK441 mode (yellow label at bottom left
of status bar).  Select menu item File | Open and navigate to
subdirectory RxWav\Samples\FSK441 under your WSJT6 installation
directory.  Double-click on the first file in this directory,
K5CZD_050723_134100.WAV.  The file will be opened and a 2-dimensional
spectrogram displayed in the main graphical area.  The decoder
produces the following text in the main text box: 

 134100 27.4 220 6 26 -21 O1JT 26 K5CZD 2626 K1JT 27 K5CZ #6

. According to the line of decoded text, this file contains a meteor
``ping'' at t = 27.4 s, lasting 220 ms, with (S+N)/N = 6 dB.  You can
see that K5CZD is sending K1JT the signal report ``26''.  In FSK441
and JT6M modes it is not uncommon to see incorrect characters near
both ends of decoded sequences, where the signal is weak.  Additional
details on message structure and information reported by the decoders
is presented later in this Guide.

. Hit the F6 key (or select File | Open next in directory) to open and
decode successive files in the FSK441 directory.  These files contain
recordings of K8EB calling KB4BWW, KC0HLN calling CQ and then working
K1JT, KM5ES working K1JT, KM5PO calling K1JT as a ``tailender,'' and
finally N9EGT calling CQ.  With any of these files you should try
left- and right-clicking on the pings to invoke the decoder at a
particular location in the file.  You can also try clicking on pure
noise, away from any ping; you should then see only garbage as decoded
text.  You can click Erase or Decode at any time to clear the display
areas and decode the most recently analyzed file again.

. Open the first KC0HLN file again.  It produces the message 

  001400  6.5  400 15 27  -21     2 CQ KC0HLN EN32 CQ KC0HLN E/31 GQ#GBYLE 

. Double-click on the callsign KC0HLN in the text window, and watch what
happens in the Tx message boxes.  The program is now ready for K1JT to
answer this CQ.

. Hit Shift-F7 to switch to JT6M mode (on Linux, use the Mode menu).
Select File | Open, navigate to inside the subfolder
RxWav\Samples\JT6M under your WSJT6 installation directory, and
double-click on the AA9MY file.  You should see a message in which
AA9MY is finishing a QSO by sending ``73 DE AA9MY'':

  142300 15.1  1.2  -2  -15      9MY 73 DE AA9MF2

. The AA9MY signal is rather weaker than those in the FSK441 examples.
Try listening to any of the files using Windows Sound Recorder, to get
a feeling for what they sound like.

. Hit F6 to read and decode successive files in the JT6M directory.
You should see AC5TM working K1SIX, AF4O working K1JT, and WA5UFH
working K0AWU.  In several files the signals are inaudible or barely
audible, yet still decodable.  The second AF4O file produces no
decoded text by default, but try right-clicking at about t = 16.6 s.
(The file time corresponding to the location of the mouse pointer is
displayed in a green label at lower left of the plot area.)  You
should be able to find several other examples of decodable text in
flat regions on the green curve.  For example, try left-clicking at 
t= 7.4 s or t = 9.8 s in the first AF4O file, or at t = 11.6 s in the
second AF4O file.

. Hit F8 to switch to mode JT65A and clear the Freeze setting.  You
should now pay some attention to the SpecJT screen as well as the main
WSJT6 screen.  (Select View | SpecJT if you have previously minimized
or deleted it.)  If the SpecJT and WSJT6 windows overlap on your
screen, you can reduce the vertical size of the SpecJT window so that
only its top half shows.  Select speed 3 on the SpecJT window and
check the following items on the SpecJT Options menu: Mark T/R
boundaries, Flatten spectra, Mark JT65 tones only if Freeze is
checked, and JT65 DF axis.  Select File | Open on the main screen,
navigate to inside the JT65A directory, and double-click on the F9HS
file name.  The SpecJT screen will show a messy spectrum cluttered
with birdies at 100 Hz intervals and other interfering signals.
However, the red curve in the main-screen graphical area shows a
strong JT65 sync tone amongst the clutter, and the decoder produces

 074800 1 -23 2.7 363 5 * K1JT F9HS JN23 1 10

. Double-click on F9HS in the text window.  You should see F9HS copied
into the To Radio box; the database will be searched and the grid
locator entered, if available; Tx messages will be generated for a QSO
with F9HS, and the Tx message pointer will be set to message number 2
so that a signal report will be sent.  During actual operation, all of
this can take place in the few seconds near the end of a reception
interval, before you start transmitting again.

. Hit F6 to open the next file.  A smaller red spike appears, and you
will see that G3FPQ is calling W7GJ:

  131900  1  -25  1.5   42  3 *      W7GJ G3FPQ IO91            1   0

. Hit Shift-F8 to select JT65B mode (use the Mode menu on Linux).
Then select File | Open, navigate to inside the JT65B directory, and
open the DL7UAE file.  The waterfall shows a strong birdie at DF = 783
Hz and several weaker signals.  The ones at DF = 223 and DF = 244 Hz
look most interesting because they show the ``speckled'' QSB typical
of EME libration fading at 2 meters.  WSJT chooses the signal at DF =
223 Hz as the most promising, and decodes it to reveal DL7UAE
answering a CQ from K1JT.  

  002400 6 -23 2.5 223 23 * K1JT DL7UAE JO62 1 10 

. The red curve shows a second spike that looks almost as good as the
DL7UAE signal (see picture on page 14).  Experiment to see if you can
determine who else might be calling.  (The answer and how to find it
are given below, in step 24.)

. When you are ready to continue, clear Freeze and AFC (you may also
want to click Erase and Clr Avg) and hit F6 to open the next file.
The green curve shows some nasty SSB QRM starting at t = 5.3 s into
the file.  (Again, you might want to listen to this file.)  Some
rhythmic broadband noise is also present, showing clearly on the green
line.  Fortunately, the waterfall looks nearly clean in the important
JT65 spectral region, and WSJT has no problem decoding the signal at
DF = -46 Hz.  EA5SE is sending K1JT the OOO signal report.  

  000400 2 -25 2.9 -46 3 # K1JT EA5SE IM98 OOO 1 10 

. Try double-clicking on the sync tone in the waterfall, or on the red
spike in the main-screen graphics area.  Either action will
automatically set DF to the selected frequency, Freeze on and Tol = 50
Hz, and will then invoke the decoder.  You can see on the red curve
that the sync-tone search range has been reduced to a range +/- 50 Hz
around the selected frequency offset Freeze DF.  Take note of the
colored tick marks on the frequency scale at the top of the SpecJT
screen.  The leftmost vertical green mark shows the selected Freeze
DF, and the horizontal band below it shows the range searched for a
sync tone.  The other green tick marks the upper limit of the JT65
data tones, and red ticks mark the frequencies that would be used for
shorthand messages.

. Hit F6 to open the next file.  You will see EA5SE sending K1JT the
shorthand message RRR.  Magenta and orange curves in the main-screen
graphics area show the measured spectra for the two distinct phases of
the shorthand message cycle.  In the waterfall display you should see
the alternating tones for RRR accurately aligned with the sync-tone
marker and the second red marker.  Hit the F6 key once more to decode
the final transmission of this QSO, with ES5SE sending 73 to K1JT.

. Uncheck Freeze and hit F6 again.  The waterfall shows a likely sync
tone with deep libration fading at DF = -22 Hz, and the decoder shows
EI4DQ sending K1JT the OOO signal report.  Double-click on the sync
tone in either window to lock him in, and hit F6 to open the next
file.  Evidently EI4DQ has received the OOO report from K1JT and is
now sending RO.

. Clear the Freeze box, check AFC, and hit F6 again to open the next
file.  Two birdies are in the passband, but WSJT ignores them and
finds a valid sync tone at DF = 223 Hz, decoding IK1UWL sending an OOO
report to K1JT.  Uncheck AFC and hit Decode; you will notice that the
first of two numbers near the end of the decoded line changes from 1
to 0, indicating that without AFC the Deep Search decoder is required
to decode this file.  Double-click on the sync tone to lock in IK1UWL,
and wait for the next transmission (i.e., hit F6 to read the next
file).  IK1UWL has copied my RO, so he is sending RRR.  Note that this
shorthand message is barely visible on the waterfall, but it is still
decoded correctly.  K1JT would now send 73 to signify that the QSO is
complete.

. Clear the Freeze and AFC boxes and hit F6 to find RU1AA calling CQ.
RU1AA has a big signal; his tones are easily audible in this file.  In
the next several files K1JT works him quickly, despite two birdies
that are drifting down through the JT65 signal passband.  Notice that
as a reminder, decoded shorthand messages are always flagged with a
``?'' mark unless you have turned Freeze on and set Tol to 100 Hz or
less -- things that you should always do, for best results.  RU1AA
ends the QSO by sending the message ``TNX JOE -14 73'' to tell K1JT
that his signal peaked at -14 dB.  Since this message does not start
with two callsigns (or CQ or QRZ plus one callsign) it is treated as a
plain text message.  Such messages can convey no more than 13
characters, so in this case the final ``73'' is truncated.

. Clear the Freeze box and hit F6 to show another big Russian signal:
RW1AY/1 is answering a CQ from K1JT.  Double-click on the sync tone
(on either window) to lock it in, and then hit F6 to see the RO, 73,
and -19TNXQSO 73 contents of the next three transmissions.

. Were you able to decode the second station answering my CQ in the
DL7UAE file?  If so, congratulations!  If not, clear Freeze and go
back to File | Open and select the first file again.  Left-click on
the smaller red spike, check Freeze on, and reduce Tol to 10 Hz.  Then
hit Decode, and you should see SP6GWB calling K1JT with an excellent
signal.  The DL7UAE and SP6GWB signals are separated by only 22 Hz, so
most of their tones overlap in the 355 Hz passband of JT65B.
Nevertheless, the decoder copies perfectly through the resulting QRM
with the help of its robust error-correcting code.

. While you have the DL7UAE file in memory, Freeze on, Tol = 10 Hz,
and DF set on the smaller red spike, hit F2 to open the Setup |
Options screen and enter your own call (or some other call) in place
of K1JT in the My Call box.  Then dismiss the Options screen and try
to decode the SP6GWB signal again.  You will surely fail, because for
this message successful copy was obtained as a result from the Deep
Search decoder, which is described further below.
