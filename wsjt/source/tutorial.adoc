=== Main Screen Basics

To use _WSJT_ effectively you will need to gain some experience 
and skill using the decoders.  To get started

- Select *FSK441* from the *Mode* menu on the main window.

- Select *File | Open*,navigate to the +RxWav\Samples+ folder in your
_WSJT_ home directory, and open the sample file
+W8WN_010809_110400.wav+.  Your main screen should look something like
the image below.  The larger graphical area displays a spectrogram in
which time increases from left to right and frequency from bottom to
top.  The green curve below the spectrogram shows total power over
the full received bandwidth.  The smaller graphical area at right
displays average spectra of the full record (magenta) and of the
strongest detected ``ping'' (red).

- Click with the right mouse button around the location of the ping at
time t = 18 s on the graphical display, and observe the decoded text
that appears.

- Click on the static crashes around t = 1 s or elsewhere on the green
line.  You will probably see garbage text.  

- Click *Erase* to clear the text and graphical areas.  

- Click *Decode* to process the full 30-second segment again.

- The sample files used in this tutorial were recorded by _WSJT_
during normal on-the-air activity.  You will find it instructive to
use Windows Media Player (or an equivalent program) to play these
audio files and listen to the signals.  The example file
+W8WN_010809_110400.wav+ starts with a burst of summertime QRN, then
nothing but background noise until a moderately strong burst of FSK441
appears some 18 seconds later.

=== Decoding Tutorial

Decoding procedures are different for the various _WSJT_ modes, and it
helps to practice with a new mode before using it on the air.  For the
following tutorial you must first obtain the collection of sample wave
files available for {samples_windows} or {samples_linux}.  These files
contain recordings of real signals in typical on-the-air situations
for each of the _WSJT_ modes.

- Extract the files to a suitable location such as +..\RxWav\Samples+
under your _WSJT_ installation directory.

- If you have already installed and used a version of _WSJT_, delete
your +WSJT.INI+ file or temporarily rename it to something else. This
will ensure that you start the tutorial with everything in the default
configuration.

- Start _WSJT_ and position the main window conveniently on your
screen.  You may ignore or minimize the other two windows for now.

.FSK441
- By default _WSJT_ starts in FSK441 mode (yellow label at bottom left
of status bar).  Select menu item *File | Open* and navigate to
subdirectory +...\RxWav\Samples\FSK441+ under your installation
directory.  Double-click on the first file in this directory,
+K5CZD_050723_134100.WAV+.  The file will be opened and a
2-dimensional spectrogram displayed in the main graphical area.  The
decoder produces the following text in the main text box:

 134100 27.4 220 6 26 -21 O1JT 26 K5CZD 2626 K1JT 27 K5CZ #6

- According to the line of decoded text, this file contains a meteor
``ping'' at t = 27.4 s, lasting 220 ms, with signal-plus-noise to
noise ratio (S+N)/N = 6 dB.  You can see that K5CZD is sending K1JT
the signal report ``26''.  In FSK441 mode it is not uncommon to see
some incorrect characters, especially near the ends of decoded
sequences where the signal is weak.  

- Hit the *F6* key (or select *File | Open next in directory*) to open
and decode successive files in the FSK441 directory.  These files
contain recordings of K8EB calling KB4BWW, KC0HLN calling CQ and
working K1JT, KM5ES working K1JT, KM5PO calling K1JT as a
``tailender,'' and finally N9EGT calling CQ.  With any of these files
you should try left- and right-clicking on the pings to invoke the
decoder at a particular location in the file.  You can also try
clicking on pure noise, away from any ping; you should then see only
garbage as decoded text.  You can click *Erase* or *Decode* at any
time to clear the display areas and decode the most recently analyzed
file again.

- Open the first KC0HLN file again.  It produces the message 

  001400  6.5  400 15 27  -21     2 CQ KC0HLN EN32 CQ KC0HLN ...

- Double-click on the callsign KC0HLN in the text window, and observe
what happens in the Tx message boxes.  The program is now ready for
K1JT to answer the CQ from KC0HLN.

.JTMS

- Switch to *JTMS* mode and open each file in the +Samples\JTMS+
subdirectory.  *JTMS* generally does a good job of finding and
decoding pings on its own.  If the ping duration is sufficient for
message repetitions to be recognizable, the decoder averages over them
and appends an asterisk +*+ to the end of the decoded line.

- You can also try clicking to decode, as in FSK441 mode.  For
example, the short, weak ping at t=7.7 s in the second file decodes
automatically as

 111730  7.7  100  3 16   15     SIY K1JT?N9VIX KT.T O2 

- By clicking at about t=7.4 s you should be able to obtain the improved
result 

 111730  7.7  120  3 26   15     K1JT?N5SIX               * 

.ISCAT
- Switch to *ISCAT-B* mode and open the first file in the +Samples\ISCAT-B+ 
subdirectory.


.JT6M
. Select JT6M on the *Mode menu.  Then select *File | Open*, navigate
to inside the subfolder +...RxWav\Samples\JT6M+ under your
installation directory, and double-click on the AA9MY file.  You
should see a message in which AA9MY is finishing a QSO by sending ``73
DE AA9MY'':

  142300 15.1  1.2  -2  -15      9MY 73 DE AA9MF2

. The AA9MY signal is rather weaker than those in the FSK441 examples.
Try listening to any of the files using Windows Media Player (or the
equivalent on your operating system), to get a feeling for what they
sound like.

. Hit *F6* to read and decode successive files in the JT6M directory.
You should see AC5TM working K1SIX, AF4O working K1JT, and WA5UFH
working K0AWU.  In several files the signals are inaudible or barely
audible, yet still decodable.  The second AF4O file produces no
decoded text by default, but try right-clicking at about t = 16.6 s.
(The file time corresponding to the location of the mouse pointer is
displayed in a green label at lower left of the plot area.)  You
should be able to find several other examples of decodable text in
flat regions on the green curve.  For example, try left-clicking at 
t = 7.4 s or t = 9.8 s in the first AF4O file, or at t = 11.6 s in the
second AF4O file.

. Switch to mode JT65A and clear the *Freeze* setting.  You should now
pay some attention to the *SpecJT* screen as well as the main _WSJT_
screen.  (Select *View | SpecJT* if you have previously minimized or
deleted it.)  If the SpecJT and _WSJT_ windows overlap on your screen,
you can reduce the vertical size of the SpecJT window so that only its
top half shows.  Select speed 3 on the SpecJT window and check the
following items on the *SpecJT | Options* menu: *Mark T/R boundaries*,
*Flatten spectra*, *Mark JT65 tones only if Freeze is checked*, and
*JT65 DF axis*.  Select *File | Open* on the main screen, navigate to
inside the JT65A directory, and double-click on the F9HS file name.
The SpecJT screen will show a messy spectrum cluttered with birdies at
100 Hz intervals and other interfering signals.  However, the red
curve in the main-screen graphical area shows a strong JT65 sync tone
amongst the clutter, and the decoder produces

  074800  1  -23  2.7  363  5 * K1JT F9HS JN23   1 10

. Double-click on F9HS in the text window.  You should see F9HS copied
into the *To Radio* box; the database will be searched and the grid
locator entered, if available; Tx messages will be generated for a QSO
with F9HS, and the Tx message pointer will be set to message number 2
so that a signal report will be sent.  During actual operation, all of
this can take place in the few seconds near the end of a reception
interval, before you start transmitting again.

. Hit F6 to open the next file.  A smaller red spike appears, and you
will see that G3FPQ is calling W7GJ: 

 131900 1 -25 1.5 42 3 * W7GJ G3FPQ IO91  1 0

. Select JT65B from the *Mode* menu.  Then select *File | Open*,
navigate to inside the JT65B directory, and open the DL7UAE file.  The
waterfall shows a strong birdie at DF = 783 Hz and several weaker
signals.  The ones at DF = 223 and DF = 244 Hz look most interesting
because they show the ``speckled'' QSB typical of EME libration fading
at 2 meters.  _WSJT_ chooses the signal at DF = 223 Hz as the most
promising, and decodes it to reveal DL7UAE answering a CQ from K1JT.

  002400 6 -23 2.5 223 23 * K1JT DL7UAE JO62  1 10 

. The red curve shows a second spike that looks almost as good as the
DL7UAE signal (see picture on page 14).  Experiment to see if you can
determine who else might be calling.  (The answer and how to find it
are given below, at the end of this tutorial.)

. When you are ready to continue, clear *Freeze* and *AFC* (you may
also want to click *Erase* and *Clr Avg*) and hit *F6* to open the
next file.  The green curve shows some nasty SSB QRM starting at t =
5.3 s into the file.  (Again, you might want to listen to this file.)
Some rhythmic broadband noise is also present, showing clearly on the
green line.  Fortunately, the waterfall looks nearly clean in the
important JT65 spectral region, and _WSJT_ has no problem decoding the
signal at DF = -46 Hz.  EA5SE is sending K1JT the OOO signal report.

  000400 2 -25 2.9 -46 3 # K1JT EA5SE IM98 OOO 1 10 

. Try double-clicking on the sync tone in the waterfall, or on the red
spike in the main-screen graphics area.  Either action will
automatically set DF to the selected frequency, Freeze on and Tol = 50
Hz, and will then invoke the decoder.  You can see on the red curve
that the sync-tone search range has been reduced to a range +/- 50 Hz
around the selected frequency offset *Freeze DF*.  Take note of the
colored tick marks on the frequency scale at the top of the SpecJT
screen.  The leftmost vertical green mark shows the selected Freeze
DF, and the horizontal band below it shows the range searched for a
sync tone.  The other green tick marks the upper limit of the JT65
data tones, and red ticks mark the frequencies that would be used for
shorthand messages.

. Hit *F6* to open the next file.  You will see EA5SE sending K1JT the
shorthand message RRR.  Magenta and orange curves in the main-screen
graphics area show the measured spectra for the two distinct phases of
the shorthand message cycle.  In the waterfall display you should see
the alternating tones for RRR accurately aligned with the sync-tone
marker and the second red marker.  Hit the *F6* key once more to
decode the final transmission of this QSO, with ES5SE sending 73 to
K1JT.

. Uncheck *Freeze* and hit *F6* again.  The waterfall shows a likely
sync tone with deep libration fading at DF = -22 Hz, and the decoder
shows EI4DQ sending K1JT the OOO signal report.  Double-click on the
sync tone in either window to lock him in, and hit *F6* to open the
next file.  Evidently EI4DQ has received the OOO report from K1JT and
is now sending RO.

. Clear the Freeze box, check *AFC*, and hit *F6* again to open the
next file.  Two birdies are in the passband, but _WSJT_ ignores them
and finds a valid sync tone at DF = 223 Hz, decoding IK1UWL sending an
OOO report to K1JT.  Uncheck *AFC* and hit *Decode*; you will notice
that the first of two numbers near the end of the decoded line changes
from 1 to 0, indicating that without *AFC* the Deep Search decoder is
required to decode this file.  Double-click on the sync tone to lock
in IK1UWL, and wait for the next transmission (i.e., hit *F6* to read
the next file).  IK1UWL has copied the report RO from K1JT, so he is
sending RRR.  Note that this shorthand message is barely visible on
the waterfall, but it is still decoded correctly.  K1JT would now send
73 to signify that the QSO is complete.

. Clear the *Freeze* and *AFC* boxes and hit *F6* to find RU1AA
calling CQ.  RU1AA has a big signal; his tones are easily audible in
this file.  In the next several files K1JT works him quickly, despite
two birdies that are drifting down through the JT65 signal passband.
Notice that as a reminder, decoded shorthand messages are always
flagged with a ``?'' mark unless you have turned Freeze on and set Tol
to 100 Hz or less -- things that you should always do, for best
decoding results.  RU1AA ends the QSO by sending the message ``TNX JOE
-14 73'' to tell K1JT that his signal peaked at -14 dB.  Since this
message does not start with two callsigns (or CQ or QRZ plus one
callsign) it is treated as a plain text message.  Such messages can
convey no more than 13 characters, so in this case the final ``73'' was
truncated.

. Clear the *Freeze* box and hit *F6* to show another big Russian
signal: RW1AY/1 is answering a CQ from K1JT.  Double-click on the sync
tone (on either window) to lock it in, and then hit *F6* to see the
messages RO, 73, and -19TNXQSO 73 in the next three transmissions.

. Were you able to decode the second station answering my CQ in the
DL7UAE file?  If so, congratulations!  If not, clear *Freeze* and go
back to *File | Open* and select the first file again.  Left-click on
the smaller red spike, check *Freeze* on, and reduce *Tol* to 10 Hz.
Then hit *Decode*, and you should see SP6GWB calling K1JT with an
excellent signal.  The DL7UAE and SP6GWB signals are separated by only
22 Hz, so most of their tones overlap in the 355 Hz passband of JT65B.
Nevertheless, the decoder copies perfectly through the resulting QRM
with the help of its robust error-correcting code.

. While you have the DL7UAE file in memory, Freeze on, Tol = 10 Hz,
and DF set on the smaller red spike, hit *F2* to open the *Setup |
Options* screen and enter your own call (or some other call) in place
of K1JT in the My Call box.  Then dismiss the *Options* screen and try
to decode the SP6GWB signal again.  You will surely fail, because for
this message successful copy was obtained as a result from the Deep
Search decoder, which is described further below.
