WSJT is a computer program for amateur VHF/UHF communication using
state of the art digital techniques.  It can help you to make contacts
using fraction-of-a-second signals reflected from meteor trails, as
well as steady signals more than 10 dB weaker than those needed for
conventional CW.  Distinct protocols or ``modes'' are provided for 
different types of propagation:

[horizontal]

FSK441:: For high speed meteor scatter.  Uses 4-tone frequency-shift
keying (4-FSK) at 441 baud, with character transmission rate 147 cps.

JTMS:: Alternative mode for meteor scatter.  Uses minimum-shift keying
(MSK) at 1378.125 baud, character transmission rate 197 cps.

ISCAT:: Optimized for meteor and ionospheric scatter on 6 meters.
Uses 42-FSK at 21.53 or 43.07 baud, character transmission rate 16.15
or 32.3 cps.

JT65:: For Earth-Moon-Earth (EME, ``moonbounce'') and weak
troposcatter.  Uses structured messages, a Reed-Solomon (63,12)
error-control code (ECC), and 65-FSK modulation at 2.69 baud.
Effective throughput is about 0.25 cps.

JT4:: Designed for EME on microwave bands.  Uses structured messages,
a K=32, r=1/2 convolutional code, and 4-FSK modulation at 4.375 baud.
Effective throughput is about 0.25 cps.

CW:: For EME using timed, computer-generated transmissions
