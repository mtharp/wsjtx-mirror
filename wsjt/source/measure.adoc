Choose *Measure* from the mode menu and activate *Monitor* to perform
measurements of relative noise power from your receiver.  The system
will record audio for one second, compute the level of noise power,
and display the result in dB relative to WSJT's standard level. This
cycle is repeated every 2 seconds, with the results plotted as a green
line and summary data displayed in the decoded text window.  You can
use this mode to measure sun noise, antenna temperature, ground noise,
preamp gain, and a host of other useful quantities relative to a
chosen reference level. Be sure to disable the receiver AGC if you
intend to use the mode for quantitative measurements. It would also be
wise to make some test measurements (for example, using a calibrated
attenuator) to confirm that the reported dB readings are reliable in
your system as configured.
