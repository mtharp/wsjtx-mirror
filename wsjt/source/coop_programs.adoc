_WSJT_ writes an output file that can be used by another program to
control antenna positioners and other equipment.  The file is updated
once per second; it contains four lines, as in the following example:

------------
18:33:35,353.8,-50.3,Moon
18:33:35,207.7, 31.4,Sun
18:33:35, 51.7, 51.4,Source
  144,   142.0,    0.90,     8.8,    1.33,Doppler, R
------------

The first three lines list the current UTC in +HH:MM:SS+ format,
followed by azimuth and elevation in degrees for the Sun, Moon, and
another astronomical source.  (Specify right ascension and declination
for the additional source on the *Setup | Options* window.)  Numbers
on the fourth line give the operating frequency in MHz, Doppler shift
to the DX station in Hz, rate of change of Doppler shift in Hz/minute,
self Doppler, its rate of change, and a single letter R or T to
specify whether _WSJT_ is presently receiving or transmitting.
