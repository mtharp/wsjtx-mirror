TIP: some controls are enabled only in certain operating modes.

[horizontal]
*Add*:: Add the displayed callsign and grid locator to the database file
+CALL3.TXT+.  If an entry for this callsign already exists, you will be
asked if you want to replace it.

*AFC*:: Enable automatic frequency control in the JT65 decoding algorithm.  

*Auto*:: Toggle on or off an automatic sequence of transmit and receive
periods.

*Clear Avg*:: Erase text in average message box, and clear message
accumulator.

*Decode*:: Analyze the most recently recorded or opened file, perhaps
after one or more decoding parameters have been changed.

*Dsec*:: Adjust UTC clock reading in 0.5 s increments to manually
resynchronize with UTC or with your QSO partner's computer.  (In
general, it is best to keep the Windows clock set accurately and *Dsec*
set to zero.)

*Erase*:: Clear all information in main text boxes and graphical areas.

*Exclude*:: Remove most recent recording from the average message
accumulator.  Use this option when you are sure that the program has
synchronized incorrectly (for example, because *DF* and/or *DT* differ
substantially from expected values) and you wish to avoid
contaminating the average message with bad data.

*F1*:: Display a list of keyboard shortcuts.

*Shift-F1*:: Display a list of special mouse commands.

*F2*:: Display the *Options* screen.

*F3*:: Toggle the status of *Tx mute*, which prevents switching into
Tx mode.

*F4*:: Clear the *To radio* and *Grid* boxes.

*F5*:: Display reminders about what message to send.

*F6*:: Open and decode next wave file in selected directory.

*Freeze*:: Search only frequencies within +/- *Tol* Hz 
of *Freeze DF*.  *Freeze DF* can be adjusted by using the left/right 
keyboard arrows.  In JT65 mode it can also be set by clicking on 
the red spike or on the *SpecJT* waterfall display.

*Gen Std Msgs*:: Generate standard messages for the mode in use.

*Include*:: If signal level is greater than -33 dB, add most recent
recording to average message accumulator even if *Sync* is less than
stated threshold.

*Log QSO*:: Click to add an entry for *To radio* to the simple log file
+WSJT.LOG+.  Logged information includes date, time, callsign, locator,
band, and mode.

*Lookup*:: Search database file +CALL3.TXT+ for entry in *To radio*. If
callsign is found, retrieve the station's *Grid* locator and use it to
calculate distance, azimuth, elevation, and Doppler shift.

*Monitor*:: Start a series of reception intervals, perhaps to monitor a
calling frequency or to copy another station engaged in a QSO.

*Save*:: Save the most recently recorded file. 

*Stop*:: Terminate the *Monitor* sequence. 

*Sync*:: Set minimum signal level or synchronizing threshold. 

*Tol*:: Set decoder's tolerance (in Hz) to frequency offsets.  

*Tx1 - Tx6*:: Transmit the selected message.  Transmission will continue
until the end of the present Tx sequence.

*Tx First*:: Check this box if you want to transmit during the first
period of the timed T/R cycle.  Uncheck it if your QSO partner is
transmitting in the first period. ``First'' is defined as the first
T/R interval of a UTC hour, and alternately thereafter.

*Tx Stop*:: Terminate a transmission and set *Auto* to OFF.

*Zap*:: Filter out birdies (narrowband signals of approximately constant
amplitude) before attempting to decode.

.Main Screen Text Boxes
[horizontal]

*Average Text*:: Displays average messages in JT65 mode.

*Decoded Text*:: Displays decoded messages and other signal information.

*Grid*:: After a successful *Lookup*, displays *Grid* locator of the
callsign in the *To radio* box.  You can also enter a locator
manually.  

*Moon*:: Current azimuth and elevation of the moon at your location,
2-way EME Doppler shift between your location and the specified grid
locator, and EME path degradation in dB for the selected band.

*Report*:: In FSK441, JTMS, ISCAT, and JT6M modes enter the signal
report you wish to send to the other station, then click *GenStdMsgs*.

*Status Bar*:: Panels at the bottom of the WSJT screen display
sample-rate factors, operating mode, *Freeze DF*, *Rx noise* level,
*TR period*, *T/R status*, and the message being transmitted.

*To radio*:: Callsign of station being called.  Text entered in this box
becomes leading part of recorded file names.
