_WSJT_ carries out a number of astronomical calculations to provide
tracking data for the sun and moon, Doppler shifts for EME signals,
sky background temperatures, etc.  You may find it useful to know
something about the nature and accuracy of these calculations.

The state of the art for establishing three-dimensional locations of
the sun, moon, and planets at a specified time is embodied in a
numerical model of the solar system maintained at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.  The model has been numerically integrated to produce
tabular data that can be interpolated with very high accuracy.  For
example, the celestial coordinates of the moon or a planet can be
determined at a specified time to within about 0.0000003 degrees.
Although the ephemeris tables and interpolation routines could easily
be incorporated into _WSJT_, the accuracy provided would be overkill for
our desired purposes.  Instead, _WSJT_ uses closed-form calculations
based on a limited number of harmonic terms that have been fit to the
high-accuracy data.

The precise algorithms used for solar and lunar positions were
developed by Van Flandern and Pulkkinen (Astrophysical Journal
Supplement Series, 44, 391-411, 1979).  Series expansions from this
paper yield accuracies of about 0.02 and 0.04 deg for the sun and moon
positions, respectively, and they will remain almost this good for
nearly a thousand years.  At this level of accuracy the effects of
nutation and aberration can be ignored, as can most of the smaller
planetary perturbations. (Perturbations involving the Moon, Jupiter,
Saturn, and Uranus are included, however.)  Ephemeris Time and
Universal Time are taken as equivalent, and the time steps associated
with leap seconds are ignored.  These and all other approximations
employed are consistent with the specified accuracy level.

The coordinates displayed for the sun are geocentric.  Since the moon
is much closer its diurnal parallax is significant, and therefore
topocentric coordinates are given for your specified location.  For
both sun and moon, the listed elevation is the apparent position of
the center of the disk.  To improve the accuracy of predicted Doppler
shifts of EME signals, a larger number of terms was used in the series
expansion for lunar distance.  _WSJT_ properly accounts for the
oblateness of the Earth when establishing locations relative to the
Earth's center.  Final accuracy of the Doppler shifts computed by _WSJT_
is better than 1 Hz at 144 MHz, and this has been confirmed by direct
comparison with a calculation based on the JPL ephemeris.

The sky background temperatures reported by _WSJT_ are derived from the
all-sky 408 MHz map of Haslam et al. (Astronomy and Astrophysics
Supplement Series, 47, 1, 1982), scaled by frequency to the (-2.6)
power.  This map has angular resolution of about 1 degree, and of
course most amateur EME antennas have much broader beamwidths than
this.  Your antenna will therefore smooth out the hot spots
considerably, and the observed extremes of sky temperature will be
less.  Unless you understand your sidelobes and ground reflections
extremely well, it is unlikely that more accurate sky temperatures
would be of much practical use.
