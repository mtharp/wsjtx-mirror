Particular thanks are due to Ralf Koetter and Alexander Vardy, whose
research paper ``Soft-Decision Algebraic Decoding of Reed Solomon
Codes,''( _IEEE Transactions on Information Theory_,'' vol. 49,
pp. 2809-2825, 2003) introduced me to the powerful decoding algorithm
now used in the JT65 modes.  Through their company CodeVector
technologies, Koetter and Vardy granted a license to use their
algorithm, protected under United States patent 6,634,007, for
noncommercial purposes in amateur radio, and to adapt their computer
code to this end.
