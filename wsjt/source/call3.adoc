As an operating convenience, WSJT makes use of a simple callsign
database file named CALL3.TXT.  A default file is distributed with the
program, but you will want to update the file yourself and perhaps
modify it to suit your regional needs.  Current versions of the
default file are maintained by DL8EBW and can be downloaded from
http://www.dl8ebw.de/DATABASE/database.html.
