A console window is provided to accommodate startup messages and
possible diagnostic messages.  At startup the window should look
something like the picture shown <<FigConsole,earlier>>.  If you have
more than one sound card, information presented here will enable you
to select the one to use for WSJT.  Enter the appropriate device
numbers as *Audio In* and *Audio Out* on the *Setup | Options* screen.
