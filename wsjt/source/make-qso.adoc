By longstanding tradition, a minimal valid QSO requires the exchange
of callsigns, a signal report or some other information, and
acknowledgments.  _WSJT_ is designed to facilitate making such minimal
QSOs under difficult conditions, and the process can be made easier if
you follow standard operating practices.  The recommended procedure is
as follows:

. If you have received less than both calls from the other station,
send both calls.

. If you have received both calls, send both calls and a signal report.

. If you have received both calls and a report, send R plus your
signal report.

. If you have received R plus signal report, send RRR.

. If you have received RRR -- that is, a definite acknowledgment of
all of your information -- the QSO is complete.  However, the other
station may not know this, so it is conventional to send 73 (or some
other conversational information) to signify that you are done.

Slightly different procedures may be used in different parts of the
world, or in the different operating modes.  Hitting the *F5* key will
cause _WSJT_ to pop up a screen that reminds you of the recommended
procedures.

To prepare for making a QSO, enter the other station's callsign in the
To radio box and click *Lookup* and *GenStdMsgs* to generate a
sequence of the commonly used messages.  If *Lookup* does not find the
callsign in the database file CALL3.TXT, you may enter the grid
locator manually.  Decide whether you or the other station will
transmit first, and check or uncheck *Tx First* appropriately.  Select
the message for your next transmission by clicking in the small circle
to the right of the message text.  Click *Auto* to start an automatic
sequence of transmission and reception intervals.  You can switch
messages while a transmission is in progress by clicking on one of the
buttons *Tx1* to *Tx6*, to the right of the circles.

Real-time spectral information is displayed graphically on the
*SpecJT* screen.  Spectrograms scroll horizontally in the ``fast''
modes (FSK441, JTMS, ISCAT, and JT6M) and vertically in the slow modes
(JT4 and JT65). You can select one of several scrolling speeds at the
top right of the SpecJT window.

At the end of each receiving period, _WSJT_ displays various properties
of a received signal on the main screen.  An example for JT6M mode
is shown below.
//, and examples for FSK441 and JT65 can be seen on pages 4 and 14 ###.  
A green line in the main graphical area
illustrates signal strength vs. time, and other lines or images
display spectral information and synchronization results, depending on
the mode.

Decoded text appears in the large box below the graphical area and is
also written to a cumulative output file, +ALL.TXT+.  The program's best
estimate of *DF*, a detected signal's frequency offset, is included on
each text line.  The accuracy of these estimates is about +/-25 Hz for
FSK441 signals, +/-10 Hz for JT6M, and +/-3 Hz for JT65.  Within these
tolerances (and subject to the stability of oscillators and the
propagation path) you should see consistent numbers in the *DF* column
during any QSO that produces usable signals.  

Double-clicking on a callsign in either one of the decoded text
windows will cause that callsign to be copied into the To radio box.
The corresponding grid locator will be looked up in the database and
the callsign inserted appropriately into the message boxes Tx1 and
Tx2.  If the decoded text line includes CQ before the selected
callsign, message Tx1 will be selected for your next transmission.
Otherwise, Tx2 will be selected.  The status of Tx First may be
changed if the time-stamp on the decoded message indicates this should
be done and if *Double-click on callsign sets TxFirst* has been
checked on the Setup menu.

 
=== FSK441 and JT6M

The FSK441 and JT6M operating modes use 30 s periods for transmission
and reception.  When a reception interval has finished the program
looks for signal enhancements produced by short-lived reflections from
meteor trails.  You can often hear such ``pings'' when they occur, and
you will see them as spikes on the green line and brighter colors in
the waterfall spectrum.  One or more lines of decoded text may result
from each ping.  By clicking in the graphical area you can force a
decoding attempt at a particular spot in a record.  You can also make
the program decode in real time, just after hearing a ping, by
clicking on the ping in the SpecJT display.

_WSJT_ attempts to compensate for relative mistuning between
transmitting and receiving stations.  By default the frequency search
range is +/-400 Hz in FSK441 and JT6M modes. You can reduce the range
by setting the value of *Tol* (for ``tolerance'') to a smaller value.
Adjustments to the decoding parameters can be made at any time by
right- or left-clicking on the parameter labels.  *Sync* sets the
minimum strength (in dB) for acceptable pings. 

In the FSK441 and JT6M modes, if *DF* lies outside the range +/-100 Hz it
will help to retune your receiver to compensate.  Do this with your
transceiver's RIT control, or by using split Rx/Tx VFOs.  In JT6M mode
you can accomplish the same thing by checking *Freeze* and using the
keyboard right/left arrows to move *Freeze DF* (as displayed in the
bottom-of-screen status bar) to the desired value.  In general you
should not change your transmitting frequency during a QSO, since your
partner will be trying to tune you in at the same time.  

In addition to the green line for overall signal strength, JT6M
produces a yellow line showing the detected strength of a JT6M
synchronizing tone (see illustration above).  JT6M attempts to
decode both individual pings and an ``average message'' based on the
entire transmission, or selected portions thereof.  An average message
is flagged with an asterisk at the right end of the decoded text line.
Clicking with the left mouse button decodes a 4 s block of data near
the mouse pointer, while the right button decodes a 10 s segment.  As
in FSK441, with marginal signals you should experiment as necessary
for best decoding.  JT6M can work with signals many dB weaker than
those required for FSK441.  You will sometimes find that clicking on a
smooth green line, even where nothing was heard and nothing can be
seen, causes callsigns or other information to pop up out of the
noise.  

Standard messages in FSK441 and JT6M are generated with the aid of
templates defined on the *Setup | Options* screen.  Default
templates are provided conforming to standard operating practices in
North America and Europe, and you can edit the templates to suit your
own requirements.  Your edits will be saved on program termination and
restored when you restart _WSJT_.  Normal FSK441 and JT6M messages can
contain any arbitrary text up to 28 characters.  The supported
character set includes 0-9, A-Z, plus . , / # ? $ and <space>.  

FSK441 and JTMS also provide a special shorthand format to transmit a
few simple messages in a highly efficient way.  The supported
shorthands are R26, R27, RRR, and 73; FSK441 and JTMS send pure tones
at 882, 1323, 1764, or 2205 Hz to convey these messages. If activity
levels are high enough that there could be some doubt about who has
transmitted a shorthand message, it is better to use normal messages
tagged with callsigns or portions thereof.  Check *Rx ST* and *Tx ST*
enable single-tone messages.

A typical minimal QSO in FSK441 or JT6M modes might look
something like the following: 

------------
1.  CQ K1ABC
2.                  K1ABC W9XYZ
3.  W9XYZ K1ABC 27 
4.                  K1ABC W9XYZ R26 
5.  W9XYZ K1ABC RRR
6.                  K1ABC W9XYZ 73
------------

Shorthand messages R26, RRR and 73 could be substituted for messages
4-6.  Step ahead to the next message in your sequence only when you
have received your QSO partner's information from his sequence.

=== JT65 

JT65 has three sub-modes: JT65A, B, and C.  They are identical except
for the spacing between transmitted tone frequencies; see
<<PROTOCOLS,Specifications of WSJT Protocols>> for details.  JT65A is
generally used at 50 MHz and below, JT65B on 144 and 432 MHz, and
JT65C on 1296 MHz.  The B and C submodes are slightly less sensitive
than mode A, but progressively more tolerant of frequency drifts and
Doppler spread.

JT65 uses 60 s transmission and reception intervals. An incoming
signal is analyzed when the receiving sequence is complete.  As shown
in the screen shot below, the resulting graphical display includes red
and blue lines along with the green line.  The additional curves
summarize the program's attempts to synchronize with the received
signal in frequency (red) and time (blue), both of which are necessary
steps in decoding the message.  You can set the minimum synchronizing
threshold with the *Sync* parameter (default value = 1).  Proper
synchronization is indicated by a sharp upward spike in the red curve
and a broader peak on the blue curve.  Locations of the peaks
correspond to time and frequency offsets, *DT* and *DF*, between
transmitter and receiver. EME signals have propagation delays of about
2.5 s and can have significant Doppler shifts.  Along with clock and
frequency errors, these effects contribute to the measured values of
DT and DF.

//image::images/jt65.png[align="center"]

JT65 is tolerant of frequency offsets up to +/-600 Hz.  Unless the
red spike is close to the left or right edge of the plot area,
retuning with RIT is not necessary.  However on bands above 432 MHz,
where EME Doppler shifts can amount to several kHz or more, you may
need to use RIT or split VFOs in order to acquire the desired signal.
Once the program has synchronized on a JT65 signal, it's best to click
on the red spike or on the sync tone in the SpecJT waterfall, check
*Freeze*, and reduce *Tol* to 100 Hz or less.  Then, in subsequent
decoding attempts, _WSJT_ will search a range of frequencies only +/-
*Tol* Hz around the selected *Freeze DF*.

In JT65 mode, double-clicking on the SpecJT waterfall or on the red
curve in the main window sets *Freeze DF* to the selected frequency,
turns *Freeze* on, sets *Tol* to 50 Hz, and invokes the decoder.
Using this handy feature, you can quickly decode a transmission at
several different values of *DF*.  Colored vertical tick marks on the
SpecJT frequency scale indicate the current setting of *Freeze DF* and
the corresponding upper edge of the JT65 bandwidth (green ticks), and
the frequencies of the shorthand message tones (red ticks).  A
horizontal green bar indicates the search range specified by *Tol* and
centered on *Freeze DF*.

The JT65 decoder uses a multi-layered procedure.  A full description
of how it works was published in {jt65protocol}.  If the Reed Solomon
decoder fails, a deeper search can be made using a matched-filter
approach.  The decoder constructs a list of hypothetical messages by
pairing each entry in the callsign database with CQ and with the home
callsign of the user.  Each trial message is encoded as it would be
done at the transmitter, including all of the forward error-control
(FEC) symbols.  The resulting patterns are then tested for good match
with the received wave file.  Even a single-character mismatch will
prevent a decoding from being achieved. You can define the list of
likely callsigns in any way you choose.  A default callsign database
named +CALL3.TXT+ is provided with _WSJT_, containing the calls of
over 4800 stations known to have been active in weak-signal work on
the VHF/UHF bands.  You should keep your list up to date and adapt it
to your own requirements.

In addition to *DT* and *DF*, decoded text lines provide information
on the relative strength of synchronization, the average
signal-to-noise ratio in dB relative to the noise power in 2500 Hz
bandwidth, and *W*, the measured frequency width of the sync signal,
in Hz.  A symbol following *W* indicates that an adequate level of
synchronization has been achieved: +*+ will be displayed for a normal
message, and +#+ for a message including the OOO signal report.  Two
numbers appear at the end of each line.  The first tells whether the
soft-decision Reed Solomon decoder succeeded (1) or failed (0).  The
second number gives a relative confidence level on a 0 to 10 scale for
results produced by the Deep Search decoder.  Shorthand messages do
not produce these numbers.

If a JT65 transmission synchronizes correctly, its spectral
information is added into an accumulating array.  Spectra from
subsequent transmissions added into this array can make it possible to
decode the average, even if individual transmissions were not
decodable.  Results of such decoding attempts appear in the *Average
Text* window.

The *Deep Search* decoder necessarily has a ``grey area'' in which it
finds a solution but may have only moderate confidence in it.  In such
cases the decoder appends a ? to the decoded text, and the
operator must make the final decision as to whether the decoding is
believable.  Be aware that because of the mathematical message
structure, incorrect decodings will not differ from the correct one in
only a few characters; more likely, they will contain wholly incorrect
callsigns and grid locators.  As you gain experience in recognizing
the graphical and numerical indications of proper message
synchronization (*Sync*, *dB*, *DT*, *DF*, *W*, and the green, red,
and blue curves), as well as the effects of birdies and other
interference, you will become adept at recognizing and rejecting the
occasional false decodes.  If it appears that an unexpected (and
perhaps exotic) station is calling you, wait until you decode the
message again in a subsequent transmission.  Random decoding errors
will seldom repeat themselves.

Several options are available for adjusting the JT65 decoding
procedure to your liking.  If you check *Decode | JT65 | Only EME
calls*, only a subset of callsigns in the database that include an
EME flag will be used in the Deep Search procedure.  Check *No
Shorthands if Tx 1* if you wish to suppress shorthand decodings when
you are still transmitting the first Tx message.  The *Decode | JT65*
sub-menu offers four options for the Deep Search decoder.  The first,
*No Deep Search*, disables it entirely.  *Normal Deep Search* turns it
on but suppresses output with confidence levels less than 3, and
*Aggressive Deep Search* allows output down to level 1.  The last
option, *Include Average in Aggressive Deep Search*, applies the Deep
Search procedure to the accumulating average as well as the most
recently received data. 

JT65 messages can have one of three basic formats: 

. Two to four alphanumeric fields with specific contents, as described
below

. Any other arbitrary text, up to 13 characters 

. Special shorthand messages RO, RRR, and 73 

The four fields of a Type 1 message usually consist of two legal
callsigns, an optional grid locator, and the optional signal report
OOO.  You can substitute CQ or QRZ for the first callsign.  An add-on
country prefix followed by /, a suffix preceded by /, a signal
report of the form -NN or R-NN, or the message fragments
RO, RRR or 73 can be substituted for the grid locator.
The minus sign in the numerical report is required, and the two-digit
number NN must lie between 01 and 30.  In circumstances where there
could be any confusion about who is sending a report or who it is
intended for, these messages including callsigns are the preferred
method of sending signal reports.  A list of the supported add-on
country prefixes can be displayed from the *Help* menu.

(...Type 2 prefix/suffix description here...)

Messages used in a minimal JT65 QSO are typically something like the
following: 

---------------
1. CQ K1ABC FN42
2.                        K1ABC G0XYZ IO91
3. G0XYZ K1ABC FN42 OOO
4.                        RO 
5. RRR 
6.                        73 
---------------

Some other examples of properly formatted JT65 messages include the
following: 

---------------
 CQ ZA/K1ABC
 CQ K1ABC/4
 ZA/K1ABC G0XYZ
 K1ABC ZA/G0XYZ OOO
 QRZ K1ABC FN42
---------------

The JT65 shorthand messages are powerful because they can be decoded
at signal levels about 5 dB below those required for standard
messages.  (In fact, they can often be decoded by ear, or by eye
directly from the SpecJT waterfall display.)  If a message starts with
RO, RRR, or 73 followed by one or more spaces, the shorthand format
will be sent.  If the message satisfies the requirements for a Type 1
message, the specified callsigns, CQ, QRZ, prefix, locator, and/or
report will be encoded and sent as entered.  With any other entry, 13
characters of arbitrary text will be encoded and sent.  The actual
message being transmitted is always displayed in the bottom right
corner of the main screen.  Yellow highlighting indicates a standard
message, blue a shorthand message, and red a JT65 plain text message.

.CW 

The _WSJT_ CW mode is provided as a convenience for operators making
EME contacts using timed transmissions of 1, 2, or 2.5 minutes
duration.  The program sends EME-style messages at fixed speed by
keying an 800 Hz audio tone, and it takes care of the timing and T/R
switching.  Receiving is left up to you, the operator.  Select the
desired period by right- or left-clicking on the label at bottom
center of the main window.  Present conventions typically use 1 minute
sequences on 50 MHz, either 1 or 2 minutes on 144 MHz, and 2.5 minutes
on 432 MHz and above.
