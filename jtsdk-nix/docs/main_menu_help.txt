UHR-DEV-TOOLS MAIN MENU HELP FILE

Navigation:  You can  move  through the file by using the cursor, page-up, 
page-down and HOME/END keys available on most keyboards.  If the lines are
too long to be displayed in the box, the  LEFT/RIGHT keys can be used to 
scroll the text region horizontally. You may also use vi-style keys h, j, 
k, l in place of the cursor keys, and B or N in place of the page-up and 
page-down keys.  Scroll up/down using vi-style 'k' and 'j', or arrow keys.
For more convenience, vi-style forward and backward searching functions
are also provided.


Description:  Add something clever here.
