WSPR-4.0 TO-DO List

* Need to bounce the file list of .f, *.a, *.h, pthread etc against the other
  apps to ensure we're using same things unless otherwise needed.

* There's several Makefiles, should we describe one Path for Windows and
  another for *Nix/BSD, Mac? Is Makefile.gfortran and .MinGW still used? If
  not, can we move them to wspr/archive ?

I dont see autoconf tools setup for them.
