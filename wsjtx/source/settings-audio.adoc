- _Soundcard_: Select the audio devices to be used for *Input* and
*Output*.  Usually the *Mono* settings will suffice, but in special
cases you can choose *Left*, *Right*, or *Both* stereo channels.

IMPORTANT: If you are select the audio output device that is also your
computer's default audio device, be sure to turn off all system sounds
to prevent transmitting them over the air.

- _Save Directory_: _WSJT-X_ can save its received audio sequences as
+.wav+ files.  A default directory for these files is provided; you
can select another location if desired.

- _JT9W Settings_: JT9W is an experimental mode designed for EME on
the microwave bands.  Values of *Bandwidth Multiplier* greater than 1
increase the tone spacing.  You can also select nonstandard values of
*DT min* and *DT max* to define the range of DT searched by the
decoder.  Most users will not want to change these settings from their
default values of -1, 2.5, and 5.0, respectively.

IMPORTANT: JT9W mode is presently enabled only in special test versions
of _WSJT-X_.
