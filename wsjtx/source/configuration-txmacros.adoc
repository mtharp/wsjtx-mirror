*Tx Macros* are an aid designed for sending free-text messages instead of those automatically generated for you in the *Main Window*. While understanding that JT65 and JT9 are not conversational modes, you can substitute any number of messages as you see fit that communicate further information than what is required for a minimally valid QSO. This menu has the following features:

- To add your custom message(s), simply enter your message in the text box at the top of the tab and click _Add_ to incorporate your new message to the entry fields provided; similarly, if you no longer wish to use a particular macro, simply select the message from the list and click _Delete_. Some suggestions you may wish to include could be messages such as: “FB SIG 73 GL”, “BIG SIG 73 GL”, “RR THX 73 GL” and so on. 

- Multiple macros can be deleted at once by making an extended selection of those you no longer require, then right-clicking to get the pop-up delete menu item.

- The order of macros (as displayed in this tab and in the *Main Window*) can be changed by dragging and dropping the macros in the configuration dialog list. You can either drag and drop one macro at a time, or you can choose an extended selection that can also be dragged and dropped.

You can access your macros from the *Main Window* screen by clicking on the “2” Tab in the *Generated Message Box* area, selecting _Free Msg_ and then using the drop down menu to select the message you’d like to send.

New TX macros can also be inserted into the list by simply pressing the ENTER key after typing a new one into _either_ of the *Main Window* free text box line edits (i.e. _Gen msg_ or _Free msg_).

In either JT65 or JT9, the maximum free-text message length is 13 characters, including spaces. Please be aware of this limitation as you craft your messages.
