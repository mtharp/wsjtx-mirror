Double-click on the dmg file and consult the +ReadMe+ file provided
therein.  Read its important installation notes before proceeding
further.

If you have already installed a previous version, you can retain it by
changing its name in the *Applications* folder (say, from _WSJT-X_ to
_WSJT-X_previous_).  You can then proceed to the installation phase.

Remember to use the Mac's *Audio MIDI Setup* utility to configure
your sound card for 48000 Hz, two-channel, 16-bit format.

Use *System Preferences* to select an external time source to keep
your system clock synchronized to UTC.
