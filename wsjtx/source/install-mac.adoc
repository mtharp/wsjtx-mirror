// Q: are these instructions up-to-date for WSJT-X v1.4?

Two different packages are available for _WSJT-X_: one for OS X
10.6 through 10.8, and one for OS X 10.9. The two packages are _not_
interchangeable.

- Select the correct package for your version of OS X (if you are unsure about which version you should choose, you can find the necessary information by clicking on the Apple menu in the upper left hand corner of your desktop and selecting, “About This Mac,” which will display your OS version) and download it to your desktop.
** {osx_108}
** {osx_109}

- Double-click on the desktop icon to create and view a new folder, +WSJT-X+.
Double-click on this folder and locate the included +Readme+ file. Review the file carefully, as it provides detailed instructions on how to configure your particular system for _WSJT-X_.

- Remember to use the Mac's *Audio MIDI Setup* utility as described in
the +Readme+ file to configure your sound card for 48000 Hz,
single-channel, 16-bit format.  Depending on your sound card you might
have to change Audio In format to 48000 Hz two-channel, 16-bit.

- Use *System Preferences* to select an external time source to keep
your system clock synchronized to UTC.

- Should you choose to use the integrated logger, you can locate your logs, and other writeable files, using the following path: +$HOME/Library/ApplicationSupport/WSJT-X+
