Two different packages are available for _WSJT-X_ v1.3: one for OS X
10.6 through 10.8, and one for OS X 10.9. The two packages are _not_
interchangeable.

- Select the correct package for your OS X and download it to your desktop.
** {osx_108}
** {osx_109}

- Double-click on the desktop icon to see a new folder, +WSJT-X+.
Drop down into that folder, where a +Readme+ file provides detailed
instructions on how to configure your system for _WSJT-X_.

- Remember to use the Mac's *Audio MIDI Setup* utility as described in
the +Readme+ file to configure your sound card for 48000 Hz,
single-channel, 16-bit format.

- Use *System Preferences* to select an external time source to keep
your system clock synchronized to UTC.
