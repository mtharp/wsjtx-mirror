Start _WSJT-X_ and select *Configuration* from its *File* menu.  Enter
the following information in your _Station Details_ section at the top:

* *My Call*: <Your Call Sign> This box only accepts calls which are usable in the JT65/JT9 protocol. Compound call signs (such as xxx/K1ABC or K1ABC/x) are handled in a different way; see <<COMP-CALL,below>> for details.
* *My Grid*: <Your Maidenhead locator> Enter your Grid Square here. You can enter either a four digit (i.e. FN20) or six digit (i.e. FN20pi) locator. Be aware, however, that not all grid squares are supported; the chances of your grid square being unsupported is unlikely. 

In the _Display_ section, you have the following options to either activate or leave disabled:

* *Blank line between decoding periods*: As configured initially, many find _WSJT-X_ ’s user display easy to read. However, some may find that a blank line inserted between decoding periods helps them delineate between decoding periods. If you feel like you need a little extra space, please select this option.
* *Display distance in miles*: If this option is selected, _WSJT-X_ will calculate the distance between your grid square and the other station’s.
* *Tx messages to Rx frequency window*: If selected, this option injects the outgoing transmission message into the *Rx Frequency* window; this message is highlighted in yellow. This option allows the user to see what message was sent during a TX period.
* *Show DXCC entity and worked before status*: If enabled, this option annotates the received decodes with information about the entity name and whether or not it has been worked before.
* *The Font Button*: This menu gives the user the ability to select the font used throughout the main program, *except* in the decoded text windows, *Band Activity* and *Rx Frequency*.
* *The Decoded text*: This menu gives the user the option to select the monospaced font to be used in the two decoded text windows, *Band Activity* and *Rx Frequency*. Only monospaced fonts are supported so as to keep the text properly aligned. 

In the _Behaviour_ section, you have the following options to either activate or leave disabled:

* *Monitor off at startup*: The Monitor button enables full CAT control and enables decoding. If you prefer _WSJT-X_ not to take over your station upon startup (which would be useful if you were already in the middle of a QSO and just warming up the program for later use) then select this option. With this option enabled, _WSJT-X_ tracks the station’s frequency but does not send any commands to the station in order to control the frequency/mode/spilt status, thereby not disrupting a currently ongoing QSO.
* *Double-click on call sets Tx enable*: The default operating procedure in _WSJT-X_ is to select the *Enable Tx* button in the user control window to begin a QSO. This default mode prevents undue transmissions. However, many forget this and attempt a QSO by double clicking on a decoded message, which does not activate the radio. By selecting this option, you are able to set _WSJT-X_ to transmit by double clicking on a decoded message.
* *Disable Tx after sending 73*: In a normal QSO sequence, the operator selects the relevant messages to send. After sending your final message, such as K1ABC G0XYZ 73, it is possible to send this message again because *Enable Tx* is still activated. If you select this option, once you send your 73 message, _WSJT-X_ will disable its transmit cycle.
* *Runaway Tx watchdog*: Occasionally, due to operator distraction, the next transmission in the series for making a minimally valid QSO will not be selected by the user. If this happens, you can continue to inadvertently send the same message repeatedly. You can prevent this from happening by selecting this option.
* *CW ID after 73*: Check to send your callsign in CW after sending 73.
* *Periodic CW ID Interval*: Selecting this option et the time interval for sending your CW identification. The default setting is 0, meaning that there will be no CW identification.
