Let us now turn our attention to the *_Radio Tab_*, the second Tab under the *Configuration* menu. This section focuses on CAT control between your radio and _WSJT-X_.

- Select your radio using the *Rig* menu.
- Select a *Serial Port* (not the same port selected for PTT control)

* *PTT method*: choose from RTS, DTR, CAT, VOX, or None.
* *PTT port*: if you will use RTS or DTR, choose a serial port.

- Set the port parameters *Serial rate*, *Handshake*, *Data bits*, 
*Stop bits* as required for your radio
- If you use {dxlcommander} or {hrd} to control your transceiver, you
can configure _WSJT-X_ to communicate with the radio through that
program.  Entries for these programs appear at the end of the
drop-down list of supported rigs.
- Click the *Test CAT Control* and *Test PTT* buttons to see that you
have established the desired control of station functions.  

Leave *Split Tx* unchecked for now. If you are using CAT control, most
radios will allow you to set *PTT method* = CAT.  Some radios support
two types of PTT assertion via CAT control: one takes audio input from
the Mic connector, the other from a rear-panel Data connector.  The
simplest CAT configuration sets *Polling interval* = 0 (no polling the
radio for dial frequency).  _WSJT-X_ can then set the radio’s
frequency, but the program will be unaware of subsequent changes made
using the radio’s panel controls.

With most radios you can set *Polling interval* to a small number (say
1 – 3 seconds) and the program will follow any frequency changes made at the
radio.  Note that you may not be able simultaneously to control the
radio from _WSJT-X_ and from another program.  Some experimentation
may be required; refer to the documentation for your rig-control
software and your radio.  It is best to have the radio and any
interface equipment turned on and connected before starting _WSJT-X_,
and to exit the program before turning the equipment off.

TIP: If you need an additional item in the list of devices for the
CAT port, edit the configuration file +wsjtx.ini+ and add your
requirement as +CATdriver=<yourdriver>+ (for example, 
+CATdriver=/dev/tty.usbserial+) in the group of entries marked
+[Common]+.
