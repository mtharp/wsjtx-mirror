A few _WSJT-X_ features behave differently in Windows, Linux, or OS X,
or may not be relevant to all operating platforms.

.Show DXCC entity and worked before status

This program option (selected on the *Settings | General* tab) is
intended mostly for use on non-Windows platforms.  Windows users
should use VK3AMA's excellent {jtalert} utility instead.

When this option is checked _WSJT-X_ appends some useful information
to all CQ messages displayed in the _Band Activity_ window.  The name
of the DXCC entity is shown, abbreviated if necessary.  Your ``worked
before'' status (according to log file +wsjtx_log.adi+) is flagged
with a single character and a change of background color, as follows:

[horizontal]
!::  (bright green) -- New DXCC entity
~::  (mid green) -- You have already worked this DXCC entity but not 
this station
 ::  (dull green) -- You have previously worked the calling station

The program does not distinguish between modes, but it does
differentiate between bands.  

_WSJT-X_ includes a built-in +cty.dat+ file containing DXCC prefix 
information.  Updated files can be downloaded from {cty_dat} when 
required.  If an updated +cty.dat+ is present in the logs folder 
and readable, it will be used in preference to the built-in one.


The log file +wsjtx_log.adi+ is updated whenever you log a QSO from
_WSJT-X_ (but note that it can also be erased from the file menu). You
can append or overwrite this file by exporting your QSO history as an
ADIF file from another logging program.  Turning *Show DXCC entity and
worked B4 status* off and on again will cause _WSJT-X_ to re-read the
log file.  Very large log files may cause _WSJT-X_ to slow down when
searching for calls.
