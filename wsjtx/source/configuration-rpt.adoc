In the _Logging_ section, there are the following four options regarding keeping a log of your contacts:

* *Prompt me to log QSO*: With this option enabled, when I send either my 73 message or my free text message, the log book pops up and reminds to log the QSO. If this option is left unchecked, _WSJT-X_ will not prompt you to log the contact.

* *Convert mode to RTTY*: Some logging programs do not recognize _WSJT-X_ modes as listed in the _WSJT-X_ produced log, i.e., JT65 or JT9. In that case, you can convert the mode in the log to RTTY in order to get credit for your digital contact.

* *dB reports to comments*: Some logging programs are inflexible in accepting non RST style signal reports. If you have such a program, select this option to place a comment field in the _WSJT-X_ log; this will keep the signal reports you exchange during a contact by placing them in the _Comments_ field. When you import your _WSJT-X_ log to your logging program, you will then have your signal reports intact and ready for QSLing. 

* *Clear DX call and grid after logging*: After logging a contact, this option clears the the previous QSO partners callsign from generated messages.

In the _Network_ box, there is the following option:

* *Enable PSK Reporter Spotting*: Check to enable sending reception reports to the
{pskreporter} mapping facility.
