Logging

* *PSK Reporter*: check to enable sending reception reports to the
{pskreporter} mapping facility.* 

"Log dB comments to log".  This places the signal report I receive from the other station in the log book section of WSJT-X

"Prompt me to log QSO" .  With this option enabled, when I send my 73 message, or my free text message, the log book pops up and reminds to log the QSO
