_Working Frequencies_: By default the *Frequency* table lists the
currently recommended dial frequencies for JT65. JT9 frequencies
generally start 2 kHz higher.  You can modify the frequency table as
desired.

- To change an existing entry, click to select it, type a desired
frequency in MHz, and hit *Enter* on the keyboard. The program will
format your frequency value appropriately and add a band designator.

- To add a new entry, right-click anywhere on the frequency table and
select *Insert*.  Enter a frequency in MHz in the popup box, then
click *OK*.  The table may include more than one frequency for a given
band.

- To delete an entry, right-click it and select *Delete*.

_Station Information_: You can save *Band*, *Offset* and *Antenna
Description* information for your station.  The antenna information
will be included in reception reports sent to {pskreporter}.  By
default the frequency *Offset* for each band is zero.  Nonzero offsets
may be added if (for example) a transverter is in use.

When all settings have been configured to your liking, click *OK* to
dismiss the *Configuration* window.
