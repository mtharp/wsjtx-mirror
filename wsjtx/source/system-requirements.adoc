Should this be moverd to global file? as it applies accross all WSJT apps.
. Maybe a Matrix would work, example.
-------------------
.System Requirments Matrix: x = Required, o = Optional .. ..
			WSJT  	WSJTX .. .. ..
CPU			1.x		1.x
RAM			128MB	1024MB
GPU			8x6		8x6
Interface	T/V/C
Audio I/O	48Khz	
T(sync)		  X		  X
I(conn)		  X		  X
Antennna	V/U/S	 HF

Ledgend:
Interface
	- T = T/R Relay
	- C = CAT
	- V = Virtual Serial Port
Audio I/O
	- 48Khz Sampling Rate Required
T(sync)
	- Time Syncronization 
I(conn)
	- USB or
Antenna
	- V {equal} VHF Antenna
	- U {equal} UHF Antenna
	- S {equal} SHF Antenna
	- HF {equal} HF Antenna

etc etc etc .. ..

- SSB transceiver and antenna 
- Computer running Windows (XP or later), Linux, or OS X
- 1.5 GHz or faster CPU and 100 MB of available memory
- Monitor with at least 1024 x 780 resolution (more is better)
- Computer-to-radio interface using a (virtual) serial port for T/R switching or CAT 
control or VOX, as is needed for your radio to computer setup
- Audio input and output devices supported by the operating system, capable of 48 kHz sample rate
- Audio or equivalent USB connections between transceiver and computer  
- A means for synchronizing the computer clock to UTC within ±1 second
