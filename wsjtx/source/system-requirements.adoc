Should this be moverd to global file? as it applies accross all WSJT apps.
. Maybe a Matrix would work, example.
-------------------
.System Requirments Matrix: x = Required, o = Optional .. ..
			WSJT  	WSJTX .. .. ..
CPU			1.x		1.x
RAM			128MB	1024MB
GPU			8x6		8x6
Interface	T/V/C
Audio I/O	48Khz	
T(sync)		  X		  X
I(conn)		  X		  X
Antennna	V/U/S	 HF

Ledgend:
Interface
	- T = T/R Relay
	- C = CAT
	- V = Virtual Serial Port
Audio I/O
	- 48Khz Sampling Rate Required
T(sync)
	- Time Syncronization 
I(conn)
	- USB or
Antenna
	- V {equal} VHF Antenna
	- U {equal} UHF Antenna
	- S {equal} SHF Antenna
	- HF {equal} HF Antenna

etc etc etc .. ..
