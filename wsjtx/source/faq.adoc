Question 1::
When I start _WSJT-X_ v1.3, it seems to run properly in receive mode, with
signals appearing on the waterfall. However, *Decode* starts later than expected
and nothing is decoded. Is this a sampling problem and how can I fix it?

A: Some earlier soundcard drivers fail to work properly at 48 kHz sample
rate, which is the default in _WSJT-X_ r3590 and above.  You can force _WSJT-X_
to sample at 12000 Hz by inserting two lines at the end of file
+wsjtx.ini+.  Using Windows Notepad, open the file +wsjtx.ini+ in your
_WSJT-X_ installation directory. Then copy-and-paste the following
two lines into the file, save the file, and restart _WSJT-X_?

 pass:[[Tune]]
 Audio\DisableInputResampling=true

Question 2::
Why does the *Flatten* feature cause my displayed spectrum to curve steeply 
upward near the edges, before falling where the radios IF filter cuts off?


A: _WSJT-X_ does not expect a steep filter edge within the displayed
passband, except perhaps a low-frequency cutoff below 200 Hz. Either use a
wider IF filter or reduce the displayed passband by decreasing
*Bins/Pixel*, increasing *Start*, and/or reducing the width of the
*Wide Graph*.  You might also need to re-center the filters passband,
if such control is available.

Question 3::
Occasionally, _WSJT-X_ unexpectedly quits. I have read this is because I set 
*Polling interval* to a nonzero value. How can I fix this issue?

A few radios do not interact properly with the +hamlib+ library calls used in
_WSJT-X_.  We are working to resolve these issues.  In the meantime,
you can run with *Polling interval* = 0, or control your radio through
_DX Labs Commander_ or _Ham Radio Deluxe_.

Question 4::
How should I configure _WSJT-X_ to run multiple instances?

A: Each instance must be executed from its own home directory.  Be sure to 
check *Advanced | Allow multiple instances* in the *Setup* menu
for each one; then exit and restart the program.  This step need be
done just once.

Question 5::
_WSJT-X_ does not set my VFO (A or B, if available) to USB for any band I 
select. Why is that?

A: Automatic setting of USB for a selected band will depend on your radio 
manufacturers implementation of CAT (Computer Assisted Transceiver) control. 
This is not standardized between manufacturers, or even between rigs from a 
given manufacturer, which makes this feature difficult to implement. _WSJT-X_ 
does not currently support setting USB mode at this time. The current best 
practices workaround is to setup your VFO(s) to USB for all bands you intend to 
work before launching _WSJT-X_, as suggested in the <<TUT_XCVR,Transceiver Setup>>,
above.

Question 6::
How do I know what settings to use for rig control (CAT) and PTT?

A: Your radioâ€™s manual will have these settings in a section for computer
setup, digital modes and TNC interface specifications. These may also
be detailed in a programmers guide which is usually offered as a
downloadable file from the manufacturers web site. As a last resort,
do a web search for something like ``rig cat for _your_rig_model_''
which should give you several places to look.

TIP: Please note: if your rig uses CAT control and PTT control on
separate cables, the port settings could very easily be different for
each cable. In any event, there may be more than one settings
configuration that works correctly. Some experimentation is likely to
be necessary.

Question 7::
How does _WSJT-X_ use both VFOs when operating in split mode?

A: Let's assume that split mode is set on _WSJT-X_ and the rig.  This is the normal mode of operating. We also assume that {plus}2 kHz is not set and  that your receiver's bandwidth is at least 4000 Hz.

Using the 20M band as an example, let's observe the waterfall window while looking for 
contacts. VFO-A, our receiving VFO, will initially be set to 14.076MHz, the nominal calling frequency for JT65.  We know _WSJT-X_ will always generate an audio signal in the range 1500Hz-2000Hz.  We now put the waterfall cursor between 1500Hz and 2000Hz at 1700Hz. 
We then see VFO-B, our transmit VFO, will also be set to 14.0760MHz. That's because 
1700Hz lies within the 1500Hz-2000Hz range, so no adjustment to the transmit frequency is 
required.  Our signal out will be 14.076MHz {plus} 1700Hz, or 14.077700MHz, which is what would show in the _WSJT-X_ log if we logged a QSO at these settings.

Now we put the cursor between 2000Hz-2500Hz at 2200Hz. We know the audio is still 
generated in the 1500Hz-2000Hz range. But now we see the VFO-B transmit frequency is 
increased by 500Hz to 14.0765MHz, which is necessary since the audio is between 1500Hz 
and 2000Hz. The transmitted frequency will now  be 14.0765MHz {plus} 1700Hz, or 
14.07820MHz.  

As a final example, let's consider what happens if the cursor is below the 1500Hz-2000Hz 
range on the waterfall, for example 1200Hz.  VFO-B must be now be reduced 500Hz to 
14.0755MHz to keep the transmitted audio in the 1500Hz-2000Hz range.  This time we use 
14.0755MHz {plus} 1700Hz, or  14.077200 MHz. 

That's great for JT65, but how does it work for JT9 split mode?
 
Similar to the above, if you want to work JT9 and your cursor is, for example, at 3700Hz then 
VFO-B will be reset to 14.078000MHz.    That is, 3700Hz - 1700Hz = 2000Hz {plus} 14.076MHz, or 
14.078000MHz.   If you remember that the audio frequency is always in the range 1500-2000 
then you can see that VFO-B must be adjusted to generate the correct transmitted frequency.

Fine business for a rig with wide bandwidth, but mine is older and has a 2500Hz bandwidth. 
How do I use split mode on my rig?

If your rig cannot be set to a received bandwidth 4000Hz, but is limited to 2500Hz, for example, 
you still set the rig to split mode and _WSJT-X_ to Split Tx in the Station settings tab.  Since you 
obviously cannot receive signals above 2500 Hz, if you want to operate primarily in the JT9 
frequency range you will need to select the {plus}2 kHz button adjacent to the band selection pull-
down. Then VFO-A will then be set up 2kHz to 14.078MHz.  The Waterfall display is relative to 
the RX frequency, namely 14.078000MHz so that the JT9 Band is now between roughly 500Hz and 
2500Hz on the waterfall display.  If the cursor is at 1700Hz, then the same calculations above 
results in VFO-B being set to 14.078000MHz. 

It is important to note that you will ONLY use the {plus}2kHz option if (1) your receiver has limited 
bandwidth AND (2) you want to operate in the JT9 band.   If you want to go back to operate on all 
of JT65, simply uncheck the {plus}2 kHz option.
