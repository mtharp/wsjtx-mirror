When I start _WSJT-X_ v1.3, it seems to run properly in receive mode, with signals appearing on the waterfall. However, *Decode* starts later than expected and nothing is decoded. Is this a sampling problem and how can I fix it?::

Some earlier soundcard drivers fail to work properly at 48 kHz sample
rate, which is the default in _WSJT-X_ r3590 and above.  You can force _WSJT-X_
to sample at 12000 Hz by inserting two lines at the end of file
+wsjtx.ini+.  Using Windows Notepad, open the file +wsjtx.ini+ in your
_WSJT-X_ installation directory. Then copy-and-paste the following
two lines into the file, save the file, and restart _WSJT-X_:

 [Tune]
 Audio\DisableInputResampling=true

Why does the *Flatten* feature cause my displayed spectrum to curve steeply upward near the edges, before falling where the radio's IF filter cuts off?::

_WSJT-X_ does not expect a steep filter edge within the displayed
passband, except perhaps a low-frequency cutoff below 200 Hz. Either use a
wider IF filter or reduce the displayed passband by decreasing
*Bins/Pixel*, increasing *Start*, and/or reducing the width of the
*Wide Graph*.  You might also need to re-center the filter's passband,
if such control is available.

Occasionally, _WSJT-X_ unexpectedly quits. I've read this is because I set *Polling interval* to a nonzero value. How can I fix this issue?::

A few radios do not interact properly with the +hamlib+ library calls used in
_WSJT-X_.  We are working to resolve these issues.  In the meantime,
you can run with *Polling interval* = 0, or control your radio through
_DX Labs Commander_ or _Ham Radio Deluxe_.

How should I configure _WSJT-X_ to run multiple instances?::

Each instance must be executed from its own home directory.  Be sure to 
check *Advanced | Allow multiple instances* in the *Setup* menu
for each one; then exit and restart the program.  This step need be
done just once.
