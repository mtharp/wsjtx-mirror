When I start _WSJT-X_ v1.3, it seems to run properly in receive mode, with signals appearing on the waterfall. However, *Decode* starts later than expected and nothing is decoded. Is this a sampling problem and how can I fix it?::

Some earlier soundcard drivers fail to work properly at 48 kHz sample
rate, which is the default in _WSJT-X_ r3590 and above.  You can force _WSJT-X_
to sample at 12000 Hz by inserting two lines at the end of file
+wsjtx.ini+.  Using Windows Notepad, open the file +wsjtx.ini+ in your
_WSJT-X_ installation directory. Then copy-and-paste the following
two lines into the file, save the file, and restart _WSJT-X_:

 [Tune]
 Audio\DisableInputResampling=true

Why does the *Flatten* feature cause my displayed spectrum to curve steeply upward near the edges, before falling where the radio's IF filter cuts off?::

_WSJT-X_ does not expect a steep filter edge within the displayed
passband, except perhaps a low-frequency cutoff below 200 Hz. Either use a
wider IF filter or reduce the displayed passband by decreasing
*Bins/Pixel*, increasing *Start*, and/or reducing the width of the
*Wide Graph*.  You might also need to re-center the filter's passband,
if such control is available.

Occasionally, _WSJT-X_ unexpectedly quits. I've read this is because I set *Polling interval* to a nonzero value. How can I fix this issue?::

A few radios do not interact properly with the +hamlib+ library calls used in
_WSJT-X_.  We are working to resolve these issues.  In the meantime,
you can run with *Polling interval* = 0, or control your radio through
_DX Labs Commander_ or _Ham Radio Deluxe_.

How should I configure _WSJT-X_ to run multiple instances?::

Each instance must be executed from its own home directory.  Be sure to 
check *Advanced | Allow multiple instances* in the *Setup* menu
for each one; then exit and restart the program.  This step need be
done just once.

_WSJT-X_ does not set my VFO (A or B, if available) to USB for any band I select. Why is that?::

Automatic setting of USB for a selected band will depend on your radio manufacturer's implementation of CAT (Computer Assisted Transceiver) control. This is not standardized between manufacturers, or even between rigs from a given manufacturer, which makes this feature difficult to implement. _WSJT-X_ does not currently support setting USB mode at this time. The current best practices workaround is to setup your VFO(s) to USB for all bands you intend to work before launching _WSJT-X_, as suggested in the <<TUT_XCVR,Transceiver Setup>>, above.

How do I know what settings to use for rig control (CAT) and PTT?::

Your radioâ€™s manual will have these settings in a section for computer setup, digital modes and TNC interface specifications. These may also be detailed in a programmer's guide which is usually offered as a downloadable file from your manufacturer's web site. As a last resort, you can do a simple web search like "rig cat for _your_rig_model_" which should give you several places to look. 

TIP: Please note: if your rig uses CAT control and PTT control on separate cables, the port settings could very easily be different for each cable. In any event, there may be more than one settings configuration that works correctly. Some experimentation is likely to be necessary.
