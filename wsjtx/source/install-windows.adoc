Execute the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions below:

- Install _WSJT-X_ into its own directory rather than in the conventional
location +C:\Program Files\WSJTX+. The suggested default directory is
+C:\WSJTX+.

- All program files relating to _WSJT-X_ will be stored in the chosen
installation directory and its subdirectories. You can uninstall
_WSJT-X_ by removing the installation directory and its contents.

- The built-in Windows facility for time synchronization is usually
not adequate. We recommend Meinberg NTP: see {ntpsetup} for
downloading and installation instructions.  

- _WSJT-X_ expects your sound card to do its raw sampling at 48000 Hz.
To ensure that this will be so when running under recent versions of
Windows, open the system's *Sound* control panel and select in turn the
*Recording* and *Playback* tabs. Click on *Properties*, then
*Advanced*, and select “16 bit, 48000 Hz (DVD Quality).”

- Should you choose to use the integrated logger, you can locate your logs, and other writeable files, using the following path: +%APPDATA%\..\Local\WSJT-X+
