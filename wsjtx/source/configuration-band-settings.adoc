enter a brief description of your antenna for each amateur band. The
antenna information will be included with reception reports to
{pskreporter}, if enabled in the *Reporting* Tab.

- In the *Working Frequencies* section, you can add a frequency to the list by right-clicking in the _Frequency_ box and selecting “Insert.” In the dialogue box, simply input the frequency you desire. Note that _WSJT-X_ recognizes amateur band frequencies and will output “OOB” for “Out Of Band,” in the description next to the input frequency.

- In order to edit your *Station Information*, again, simply right-click in the Station Information box and select “Insert.” You can add _Band_, _Offset_ and _Antenna Description_ information as desired.

Once you have configured all the settings to your liking, click *OK* to dismiss the *Configuration* window. You are now setup to operate and make _WSJT-X_ contacts!
