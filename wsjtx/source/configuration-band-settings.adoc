_Working Frequencies_: By default the _Frequency_ table is populated
with currently recommended dial frequencies for JT65. You can modify
the table as desired.

- To change an existing entry, click to select it, type a desired
frequency in MHz, and hit Enter on the keyboard. The program will
format your entry appropriately and add a band designator.

- To add a new entry, right-click anywhere on the table of frequencies
and select *Insert*.  Type your desired frequency (in MHz) in the
popup box, and click *OK*.  More than one frequency is permitted on a
given band.

- To delete an entry, right-click and select *Delete*.

_Station Information_: You can add *Band*, *Offset* and *Antenna
Description* information as desired.  Antenna information will be
included in receprion reports sent to {pskreporter}.  By default the
*Offset* for each band is 0.000.  Nonzero values may be added as
calibration corrections or if (for example) a transverter is in use.

When all settings have been configured to your liking, click *OK* to
dismiss the *Configuration* window. You are now setup to operate and
make _WSJT-X_ contacts.
