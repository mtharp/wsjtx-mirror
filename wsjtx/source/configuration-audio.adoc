- _Soundcard_: Select the devices to be used for audio *Input* and
*Output*.  The *Mono* settings will normally suffice, but in special
cases you can choose to select *Left*, *Right*, or *Both* stereo
channels.

IMPORTANT: If you are using a sound card that is also your computer's
default audio device, be sure to turn off all system sounds to prevent
transmitting them over the air.

- _Save Directory_: _WSJT-X_ can save received audio sequences as
+.wav+ files.  A default directory for these files is provided; you
can select another location if desired.

- _JT9W Settings_: JT9W is an experimental mode designed for EME on
the microwave bands.  Values of *Bandwidth Multiplier* greater than 1
increase the tone spacing.  You can select nonstandard values of *DT
min* and *DT max* to define the range of DT searched by the decoder.

IMPORTANT: JT9W mode is presently enabled only in special test versions
of _WSJT-X_.
