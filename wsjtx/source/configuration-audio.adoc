- _Soundcard_: Select the devices to be used for audio _Input_ and
_Output_.  Normally the *Mono* settings will suffuce, but in special
cases you may choose to select *Left*, *Right*, or *Both* stereo
channels.

- _Save Directory_: _WSJT-X_ can save received audio as +.wav+ files.
A default directory for these files is provided, but you can select
another location if desired.

- _JT9W Settings_: JT9W is an experimental mode designed for EME on the
microwave bands.  Values of *Bandwidth Multiplier* greater than 1 increase
the tone spacing, and you can select nonstandard values for the range
of DT values to be searched by the decoder.
