Source code for _WSJT-X_ is available from a public repository at
{devsvn}. To compile the program you will need to install the
following packages:

- Subversion
- Qt 5.x
- g++
- gfortran
- fftw3
- hamlib
- MinGW (for Windows only)

With Subversion installed, the WSJT-X source code can be downloaded
with the command:

 svn co svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/branches/wsjtx

A Developerâ€™s Guide for _WSJT_ and its sister programs is currently
under development. The present draft contains full instructions for
compiling _WSJT-X_ in Linux, along with an outline of steps required
to compile the program in Windows.  Consult the {dev_guide} for
further hints, tips, and instructions.
