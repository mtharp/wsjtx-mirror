to post there.


		Release: WSJT-X Version 1.8.0
		       October 27, 2017
		-----------------------------

This is the full General Availability release of WSJT-X Version 1.8.0.

Changes from WSJT-X Version 1.8.0-rc3 are very minor:

 - Right-click on the Wide Graph now pops up a Context Menu.  Select
   the item *Set Rx & Tx Offset* to complete a one-handed setting of
   both red and green frequency markers.

 - Several clarifications and additions to Tool Tips and the User Guide.


We recommend that all users should upgrade to WSJT-X Version 1.8.0.

If you upgrade from v1.8.0-rc1 it may be necessary to do a one-time
reset of the default list of suggested operating frequencies.  Go to
*File->Settings->Frequencies*, right click on the table and select
*Reset*.


		Release: WSJT-X Version 1.8.0-rc3
		        October 16, 2017
		---------------------------------

Most (but not all) changes since Version 1.8.0-rc2 involve user
control of the increasingly popular FT8 mode.  The "RC3" release also
includes minor bug fixes and updates to the WSJT-X User Guide.  

The following list includes all of the more important changes:

- New optimization of GUI for simplex and split behavior in FT8 mode.

    1. Checkbox "Lock Tx Freq" on main window is relabeled "Hold Tx Freq".

    2. Double-clicking on decoded messages that do not contain your own
    call moves both Rx and Tx frequencies.  If the first callsign is
    your own call, only Rx freq moves.

    3. Double-clicking on decoded messages moves the Rx frequency.  If
    "Hold Tx Freq" is checked, Tx frequency is moved only if CTRL was
    held down.

    4. Clicking on the waterfall moves Rx and Tx frequencies as
    before: Rx only on a simple click, Tx only on SHIFT-click, and
    both on CTRL-click.  This happens even if "Hold Tx Freq" is
    checked. 

- Add a semi-automated "FreqCal" procedure: see *Solve for calibration
parameters* on the Tools menu.

- Improv auto-sequencing behavior: stop and on-frequency
transmission if a called station comes back to someone else.

- Improve S/N estimation in some situations involving QRM.

- Fix an initialization issue with user-modified application fonts.

- Fix an issue with Tx5 message generation with Type 2 compound calls.

- Enhance and improve the ADIF parser of logbook records.  Update
the band limits as per ADIF 3.0.6 specification.

- Increase the FT8 DT range to +/- 2.5 s.

- Do not allow window manager events to close the astronomical data
window.

- Add an "Erase" item to the context (right-click) menu for decoded
text.

- Extend UDP messages with an "off air" boolean field indicating that
the decode was derived from a .WAV file playback rather than an on air
reception.

- Extend reference applications to use the new off air decode message
field.

- Improve performance of FT8 decoder, especially for overlapping
signals.

- Allow specialized use of "x2 Tone Spacing" in FT8 and slow JT9
modes.

- Move "NA VHF Contest Mode" checkbox to main screen.  Query the
operator if d > 10000 km.

- Adjust UI to improve portability with font size changes and between
platforms.

- Extend UDP Reply message to support keyboard modifiers.  This allows
UDP servers to emulate keyboard modified double-clicks on decoded
messages, e.g. ALT+double-click for replying to a CQ or QRZ call
without changing ones Tx frequency offset.

- Update the cty.dat file (21st Sept 2017).

- Ensure that Fast Graph is properly initialized.

- Better handling of worked before and country name display.  Appended
text is added at a fixed column unless the message overlaps in which
case the appended information floats to the right.

- Restore printing of MSK144 decode quality information.

- Display Echo Graph automatically when Echo mode is started.

- Fix a bug that prevented double-click on a JT65 EME-style "OOO"
message from populating the Tx message boxes.

- Fixed behavior with double-click on 'CQ <AA-ZZ> <call> <grid>.'

- Update the "blank line" divider with band ID at 4*TRperiod/5.

- Fix cty.dat lookups that were not honouring exact match flags

- Add some further Copyright protections.

- Fix a bug involving "firstcall contains mycall" but not equal to mycall.

- Fix an issue with editing IARU regions in the working frequencies table.




		Release: WSJT-X Version 1.8.0-rc2
		        September 2, 2017
		---------------------------------

Implementation of FT8 and its auto-sequencing feature is now more
capable and more polished.  The decoder is faster and better: it now
includes signal subtraction, multi-pass decoding, and the use of
accumulated "a priori" information as a QSO progresses.  Sensitivity
extends downward as far as -24 dB in some circumstances.  Overlapping
signals 2 and 3 deep are frequently decoded at essentially the same
frequency.  On a crowded band we sometimes see more than 30 decodes in
a single 15-second interval, over a 2 kHz window.  The North American
VHF Contesting Mode has been extended to include both FT8 and MSK144
modes.

The "RC2" release also includes many minor bug fixes and an
extensively updated WSJT-X User Guide.

Depending on what code revision you upgrade from, it may be necessary 
to do a one-time reset of the default list of suggested operating 
frequencies.  Go to *File->Settings->Frequencies*, right click on 
the table and select *Reset*. 


		Release: WSJT-X Version 1.8.0
		-----------------------------

NEW FEATURES IN WSJT-X Version 1.8.0
------------------------------------

1.  New mode called FT8: sensitivity down to -20 dB on the AWGN
    channel; QSOs 4 times faster than JT65 or JT9; auto-sequencing
    includes an option to respond automatically to first decoded
    reply to your CQ.

2.  New mode for accurate Frequency Calibration of your radio.

3.  Improved performance of decoders for JT65, QRA64, and MSK144.
    MSK144 includes facilities for amplitide and phase equalization
    and an "SWL" mode for short-format messages.
    
4.  Options to minimize screen space used by Main and Wide Graph
    windows.
    
5.  Enhanced management scheme for table of operating frequencies, and
    a new set of default frequencies specific to the three IARU
    Regions.
    
6.  Improved CAT control for many rigs, including those controlled
    through Commander or OmniRig.
    
7.  New keyboard shortcuts to set "Tx even/1st" ON or OFF.

8.  A number of (mostly minor) bug fixes and tweaks to the user
    interface.  For example: new behavior for the audio level slider;
    correctly logged QSO start times in certain situations; correct
    control of FT-891/991 and some other radios via rigctld.

At the time of the v1.8.0-rc1 release the following tasks are yet to
be completed:

1.  Updates to WSJT-X User Guide.
2.  Sample files for FT8.
3.  Enhanced decoding using AP ("a priori") information.
4.  Signal subtraction and multi-pass decoding.
5.  Option to Auto-respond to the weakest responder to your CQ.


Installation packages for Windows, Linux, OS X, and Raspbian can be 
downloaded from the WSJT web site:
http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx.html

Please send bug reports to either wsjtgroup@yahoogroups.com or
wsjt-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.  Such reports should include a full
prescription of steps to reproduce the undesired behavior.  You must
be a subscriber to post to either of these lists.


		Brief Description of the FT8 Protocol
		-------------------------------------

WSJT-X Version 1.8.0 includes a new mode called FT8, developed by K9AN
and K1JT.  The mode name "FT8" stands for "Franke and Taylor, 8-FSK
modulation".  FT8 uses 15-second T/R sequences and provides 50% or
better decoding probability down to -20 dB on an AWGN channel.  An
auto-sequencing facility includes an option to respond automatically
to the first decoded reply to your CQ.  FT8 QSOs are 4 times faster
than those made with JT65 or JT9.  FT8 is an excellent mode for HF
DXing and for situations like multi-hop E_s on 6 meters, where deep
QSB may make fast and reliable completion of QSOs desirable.

Some important characteristics of FT8:

  - T/R sequence length: 15 s
  - Message length: 75 bits + 12-bit CRC
  - FEC code: LDPC(174,87)
  - Modulation: 8-FSK, tone spacing 6.25 Hz
  - Constant-envelope waveform
  - Occupied bandwidth: 50 Hz
  - Synchronization: 7x7 Costas arrays at start, middle, and end
  - Transmission duration: 79*1920/12000 = 12.64 s
  - Decoding threshold: -20 dB; several dB lower with AP decoding
  - Multi-decoder finds and decodes all FT8 signals in passband
  - Optional auto-sequencing and auto-reply to a CQ response
  - Operational behavior similar to JT9, JT65

We plan to implement signal subtraction, two-pass decoding, and use of
a priori (AP) information in the decoder.  These features are not yet
activated in v1.8.0.

We haven't yet finalized what the three extra bits in the message
payload will be used for.  Suggestions are welcome!
