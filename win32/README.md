## JTSDK

is a collection of several open source development frameworks (QT, Python, Tcl/Tk), Gnu tools (Coreutils, etc), isolated development environments ( Windows CMD, MSYS/Bash, Cygwin/Bash ), utility packages and customized build scripts.

Efforts have been taken to minimize custom package configurations, allowing the end-user to install / update most of the packages manually if desired. Those that cannot be updated, will have comments to that affect on their respective page. Both on-line and off-line installers will be provided.
