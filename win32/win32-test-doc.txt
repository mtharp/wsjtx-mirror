Rig control paths are now set in the Makefile by parsing the variable QTVER. The
default is set to QT55. You must build Hamlib3 with JTSDK before compiling
PyFMT, either with QT52 or QT55, as the paths are hard coded. To change back / 
uyse QT52 rather than QT55, add the variable at make time, for example:

To set QT52 v.s. QT55:

mingw32-make QTVER=QT52 -f Makefile.jtsdk install

If the Makefile does not find the appropriate path / file combinations, most
likely due to the fact Hamlib3 has not been built, the Makefile will exit with
an error stating "..missing destination file operand after..", meaning,
the files could not be found to copy.


Build and Installation
======================
1. Open JTSDK-PY
2. cd C:\JTSDK\src
3. svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/branches/fmt
4. cd C:\JTSDK\src\fmt
5. mingw32-make -f Makefile.jtsdk2 install


Run and Test
============
1. Open JTSDK-PY if not already open.
2. cd C:\JTSDK\fmt\install\bin
3. fmtmain.exe
4. Select options [1], set your station and rig parameters, Then Save Button
5. Click on the Show Button to view the fmt.ini, then Exit Button
6. Select option [4] on the menu to exit.
7. cp fmt.ini ..\
8. cd ..\
9. Edit gocal.bat, add your desired frequencies
10. Set your rig to USB and turn off or 0 RIT
11. .\gocal.bat
12. Edit fmt.all results per the current FMT User Guide, located at:

http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/k1jt/FMT_User.pdf

13. fmtave.exe fmt.all
14. fcal.exe fmtave.out
15. If it was a good run, add the the resutls in the WSJT-X WSPR settings
Done!
