TO-DO

* Need to bounce the file list of .f, *.a, *.h, pthread etc against the other
apps to ensure we're using same things unless otherwise needed.
* There's several Makefiles, should we descide on one Path for Windows and
another for *Nix/BSD, Mac?
* I dont know what huser_hardware.bat/.py are for, maybe they are Joe's to set specific
antennas based on the band section.
