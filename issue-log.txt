wsjtx-1.4.0-rc1
===============
Release candidate abandoned due to packaging issues on Linux.

wsjtx-1.4.0-rc2
===============

Mac installer - g4wjs, Bob n7rjn - Cannot expand archive in RO DMG.

    g4wjs: Move tarball to Desktop or somewhere else before expanding.

    g4wjs: Fixed in CMake generated Drag & Drop installer. Closed.

Hamlib TS-2000 - k1jt - WSJT-X "Mode" != "None" glitches when Tx QRG changes

    g4wjs: Trying  to read  "other" VFO mode  requires FRn  command to
    	   other" VFO which is source of glitch when split.

    g4wjs:  Current best  workaround is  to  set "Mode"  to "None"  in
    	    Settings which stops WSJT-X trying to manipulate rig mode.

    g4wjs: Won't fix - Closed.

Hamlib FT-847 - Eddy g6uqi - fails to start
Hamlib FT-847 - Mark w7mem - fails to start

    g4wjs: Sent version with CAT trace - waiting log file.

    g4wjs: HamlibTranceiver::init_rig() not coping with no get VFO and
    	   no toggle VFO CAT command available, changed to just assume
    	   A/MAIN is always the Rx VFO on such rigs.

    g4wjs: Sent g6uqi a test version of RC3 with a fix for this.

    g4wjs: g6uqi  reposts that this  hot fix (r4449) has  resolved the
    	   issue.

    g4wjs: Fixed wsjtx-1.4 (r4449) - Closed.

Commander TS-2000 - Jim wb6dkh - SPLIT disappearing
Commander TS-2000 - David wd4kpd - possibly the same issue

    g4wjs: VOX keying might be the factor.

    g4wjs: Sent logs to Dave aa6yq for comment.

    g4wjs:  Further investigation  now  points to  the auto-atu  which
    	   swaps  VFO and  mode while  tuning, this  may be  confusing
    	   Commander.

    g4wjs:  Dave aa6yq  confirms  that WinWarbler  will interact  with
    	   Commander and  cause this  issue when the  TS-2000 auto-ATU
    	   switches to CW  during the tuning sequence.  Passed info on
    	   to wb6dkh & wd4kpd.

    g4wjs: Not fixed for wd4kpd as he doesn't use WW. Sent tracing RC2
    	   awaiting log and match Commander ErrorLog.txt.

    g4wjs: Logs  received from wd4kpd.   Unexpected drop out  of split
    	   reported by Commander when  setting Tx frequency. Forwarded
    	   to aa6yq for analysis.

    g4wjs: Dave aa6yq  reports that setting Tx  frequency clears split
    	   on this rig (I guess many others too that use Kenwood style
    	   CAT  commands). He  suggests  setting  Tx frequency  before
    	   setting split. This is slightly problematic because setting
    	   split has  side effect  of setting  mode on  Tx VFO  and on
    	   Yaesu and Elecraft changing from CW to another mode applies
    	   a small frequency  offset :( We may have to  accept this as
    	   it will be rare and there is no explicit way of setting the
    	   mode of the  Tx VFO in the Commander  interface.  The other
    	   workaround  of  doing   everything  twice  (TxFreq,  Split,
    	   TxFreq, Split) will glitch the Rx or Tx twice as much.

    g4wjs: Seems  that split  needs to  be set  both before  and after
    	   every change of Tx frequency.   Before to satisfy rigs like
    	   the Icom IC-756 and after  to satisfy rigs like the Kenwood
    	   TS-2000.

    g4wjs:  Sent out  a test  version to  wb6dkh, wd4kpd  and aa6yq  -
    	   awaiting feedback.

Commander TS-2000 - Jim wb6dkh - Fake split

    g4wjs: Leaving wrong QRG (Tx) current.  Need trace for this issue.

Flex 6000 (TS-2000 emulation) - George kf2t - fails to read QRG
Flex 6700 - Ed k0kc - No CAT no PTT

    g4wjs: Flex doesn't have FB; command.

    g4wjs: Sent kf2t test version that  doesn't query TX QRG if not in
    	   split.

    g4wjs: Sent RC3 preview with a hotfix (r4434) to kf2t & k0kc.

    g4wjs: Caveats with SmartSDR & FlexRadio SDRs:-

           * Data mode  cannot be  set from WSJT-X,  USB should  be OK
             otherwise use "None" and set mode manually.

           * Split operation  is not possible,  this should not  be an
             issue  given that  wide  band Tx  is  available on  these
             radios.

    g4wjs: Initial reports from kf2t indicate a successful fix.

    g4wjs: Reported as working as expected by kf2t.

Hamlib FlexRadio (DTTSP UDP & IPC interfaces) - - Need to diagnose and check if these work

    g4wjs: Hamlib has a FlexRadio back  end that talks UDP on 19001 or
    	   /dev/shm/SDRcommands .

Windows (Finestra WM) - Josh kk1d - Application not staying inside virtual desktop

Hamlib TS-570D - Peter Pauly w0vll - Protocol error while getting TX frequency
Hamlib? TS-570 - ??? n4au - Polling causing errors

    g4wjs: Split not required so r4434 may have resolved this anyway.

    g4wjs: Sent trace version of RC2 to Peter.

    g4wjs: Log  shows many corrupt  and truncated CAT  responses.  The
    	   TS-570(D) is known to have  fragile CAT handling. I need to
    	   look  at hamlib  to investigate  remedies at  the character
    	   exchange level.

Hamlib FT-450 - Rudy ve3bdr - Protocol error while getting mode of split VFO

    g4wjs: May be fixed by r4434.  I have asked Rudy to try again with
    	   Mode" set to "None".

    g4wjs: Not fixed. Sent trace version of RC2, awaiting log.

LXDE desktop Ubuntu - Craig wb3gck - No application menu bar

    g4wjs: Suggested installing or un-installing appmenu-qt5 package.

    g4wjs: Un-installing appmenu-qt5 resolved this issue.

    g4wjs: Closed.

Hamlib IC-7100 - Erik on4pb - CAT PTT method not available on IC-7100

    g4wjs: This has been identified as a HamlibTranceiver registration
    	   defect.  PTT type categories incorrectly registered.

    g4wjs: Sent hot fix version of RC3 to on4pb for testing.

    g4wjs:  Further   problem  reported   with  poll  of   PTT  status
    	   failing. This appears  to be a hamlib defect  with ptt type
    	   being RIG_PTT_SERIAL_CAT instead of RIG_PTT_RIG.  Asked for
    	   clarification on hamlib-devel ML.

Hamlib IC-746 - Doc kb3mow - Wrong Tx QRG used after dbl-click on decode

    g4wjs: Asked for more details of exact Rx/Tx dial QRGs.

    g4wjs: Explanation appears  to show Tx QRG out by  500Hz.  I can't
    	   see any  obvious way this  can happen. kb3mow  has reported
    	   that he can no longer reproduce this issue.

    g4wjs: On Hold.

Hamlib ANAN-100D (PowerSDR mRX PS v3.2.19) - Ton pa0tbr - split mode not working
Hamlib ANAN-100D (Openhpsdr mRX) - Bob wd6dod - CAT control not working
Hamlib hermes (PowerSDR mRX) - Serge r6yy - Cat & PTT not working

    g4wjs: Not urgent  as split mode not required due  to wide band Tx
    	   available.

    g4wjs: Sent hot fix version of v1.4 with mods for SmartSDR TS-2000
    	   emulation.

    g4wjs:  pa0tbr &  r6yy  report successful  operation with  patched
    	   version.

    g4wjs: Fixed (mostly) r4434.

    	   OmniRig  TS-590S  -  Randy  k5rhd -  OmniRig  server  going
offline error  OmniRig Omni VII  - Bert  w0rsb - OmniRig  server going
offline error

    g4wjs: Issues  with clearing the  error.  Probably the  "Test CAT"
    	   not always able to start OmniRig client cleanly issue.

    g4wjs: Sent a tracing version of RC2 - awaiting log.

Hamlib R8500 - Chris (UK SWL) airguzzler@btinternet.com - Hamlib IO error

    g4wjs: Probably port mis-configuration. Awaiting update.

CW synthesiser - Jim n4st - Distorted CW Id

    g4wjs: Sounds horrible, something is broken in the envelope shaper.

Commander KX3 - Neil kb3tvu - occasionally stuck in TX after normal TX period

    g4wjs: Advised  to build a CAT  trace executable and send  log for
    	   analysis - awaiting log.

    g4wjs:  Log is  normal  with  PTT on/off  commands  being sent  to
    	   Commander at  the correct times. Asked  kb3tvu to reproduce
    	   again with Commander tracing on also - awaiting logs.

Log files - Wayne m0way - Would like links on desktop to log files

    g4wjs: This is probably a good idea, I'm not sure that the desktop
    	   is  the best  place for  them but  there must  be somewhere
    	   sensible  and more  visible  to put  such  links.  Need  to
    	   investigate CPack NSIS generator to find the best way to do
    	   this.

    g4wjs: A similar feature on Linux/Mac should be possible.

    g4wjs: Proposed for v1.5.

Waterfall - Jean f8rz - Requesting different labelling

    g4wjs: Would like  frequency ticks to be at  absolute multiples of
    	   500Hz   even   when  start   frequency   is   not  such   a
    	   multiple. E.g.  for start 200Hz  ticks (and labels) at 200,
    	   500, 1000, 1500, ...

    g4wjs: Proposed for v1.5.

    	   Implemented by Joe in r4464.  (Others please test!)

Decoding - Jean f8rz - Abandoned Tx should not disable decoding for a period

    g4wjs: This is an outstanding issue in at least v1.3 also.

    g4wjs: Needs changes  to Detector class to allow  audio buffers to
    	   be  not cleared  by transmitting.   Complications arise  in
    	   that any data  from prior receive periods  must be cleared.
    	   Might  be as  simple  as clearing  the  audio buffer  after
    	   decoding but may be complicated when decoding overlaps next
    	   period.  Double  buffering may be an  option.  Question: is
    	   the audio buffer needed after the last symspec call?

	 K1JT: I agree that this has been a desirable change.  Perhaps 
	 can zero only a small part of the buffer -- samples taken 
	 while Tx was on?

Decoded text - Albert kc8kjf - Report or grid last character truncated

    g4wjs: This  occurs with larger  fonts sizes on long  decoded text
    	   lines e.g.   two 6 character  callsigns and a R+  report or
    	   locator.  There  is a  defect somewhere in  the DisplayText
    	   class with font  metric calculations.  I'm not  sure why we
    	   even  try to  truncate the  message text  given that  it is
    	   rendered in a <pre/> element and therefore doesn't wrap.

    g4wjs:  This can  be resolved  by choosing  a small  font size  or
    	   increasing the main window width a little.

    g4wjs: Proposed for v1.5.

	K1JT: on the system I tested, it was OK after making the main
	window a bit wider.  It has something to do with having 
	selected "Show DXCC entity and worked before status" when the
	main window was not (then) large enough?

HRD FTDX3000 - Jean-Michel f6eao/p - Not working

    g4wjs: This  as yet untested rig  with WSJT-X + HRD  clearly needs
    	   some adjustment to the initialization in the HRDTransceiver
    	   class.

    g4wjs:  Requested the  "HRD  Interface  Information.txt" file  for
    	   analysis.

Multi-instance support - Bill g4wjs - Lock mechanism needed to avoid duplicates

    g4wjs: There  is no  check that multiple  instances are  being run
    	   with the same rig-name.  Some  mechanism to control this is
    	   desirable.  A  simple mechanism  that isn't prone  to false
    	   positives (i.e.  not relying on lock files being deleted on
    	   exit) needs to be developed.

    g4wjs: Implemented in v1.5. - Closed.

Hamlib Omni VII - Bert w0rsb - Reports incomplete support

Worked B4 - Dan k4shq - Incorrect country name occasionally

    g4wjs: Also happened in v1.3.

    g4wjs: Asked for example.

CAT retries - George kf2t - Requests that 1 or 2 retries be made automatically

    g4wjs: Requirement comes from using a FlexRadio 6700 which briefly
    	   interrupts   the   CAT   connection   when   changing   rig
    	   profiles. Suggests  a couple of automatic  retries would be
    	   helpful.

Hamlib K3 - Bob n7rjn - Comms timeout error every 10-15 mins

    g4wjs: Sent CAT trace version - awaiting log.

    g4wjs: Log shows incomplete responses to CAT commands from the K3.
    	   Stop bits was set to 2,  K3 is 1 stop bit. Suggested trying
    	   with  1 stop  bit and  if that  fails a  lower baud  rate -
    	   awaiting log.

    g4wjs: Log  with 1 stop  bit is much  better but still  losing CAT
    	   around 50s. May be CPU  load related issue but is happening
    	   in both Tx and Rx periods which is hard to explain.

    g4wjs: n7rjn  is using Mac  OS X  10.9 Mavericks and  the Timewave
    	   Navigator  he  uses  for  interfacing  has  a  custom  FTDI
    	   USB-serial driver  on Mac.  This only  has instructions for
    	   10.7 & 10.8 so it may  not be compliant with 10.9. Informed
    	   n7rjn.

    g4wjs: Awaiting results of tests at lower CAT serial baud rate.

    g4wjs: This  is looking  like an  issue with  the Elecraft  P3 not
    	   passing thru  all CAT traffic correctly.   n7rjn has tested
    	   for 1hr without P3 in  line without error. Awaiting results
    	   with P3 upgraded to latest firmware.

    g4wjs: n7rjn  updates Elecraft P3  firmware from 1.26 to  1.29 and
    	   the  issue appears  to be  greatly improved  but successive
    	   "IF;" CAT commands sometime still  cause the second to only
    	   respond ";" and retries return  nothing. So it seems the P3
    	   (or possibly the K3) still have an issue with CAT.

    g4wjs: n7rjn testing again without P3.

    g4wjs:  Tests passed  which seems  to confirm  that the  latest P3
    	    firmware still has a CAT  pass through issue. Bob will log
    	    a case with Elecraft.

    g4wjs: Closed.

    g4wjs: P.S. differently from first thougth, the P3 can be set to a
    	   lower baud  rate than the  K3 <->P3 fixed 38.4k  baud. This
    	   will  probably eliminate  the issue.   n7rjn is  testing at
    	   19.2k baud.

Commander - Mike k2oi - Not connecting hostname lookup error

    g4wjs:  This may  be due  to the  "Network Server"  setting having
    	   spaces in it  which causes the hostname  lookup to override
    	   the default hostname.

    g4wjs: Changed to trim network query name (r4468).

Commander K3 - Joe w4tv - K3 not going to split

    g4wjs: This appears to be because  the K3 will not switch to split
    	   unless the mode  of VFO B ahs been preset  to match that of
    	   VFO A.

    g4wjs:  Joe has  also  offered  to help  with  testing WSJT-X  CAT
    	   issues.

    g4wjs: Dave aa6yq is copied on discussions with Joe.

Commander IC7200 - John wa2hip - Occasionally not setting up split correctly

    g4wjs: I'm  not sure exactly  what is  not set correctly  and have
    	   asked ws2hip to clarify.

	  From wa2hip:
	  ****************
	  Here is a general example. This is with running CAT via Commander

	  VFO-A 14076
	  VFO-B 14076.5

	  Enable TX
	  Rig goes into TX switching to VFO-B
	  VFO-B immediately switches to 14076 while in TX (no I do not have the "change when in TX" box checked)

	  Now I am TX on incorrect freq so I HALT TX

	  This happens a fair share of the time.

	  IT DOES NOT happen with Direct Control (NO Commander)
	  ****************


Hamlib IC7200 - John wa2hip - Occasional incorrect rig setting

    g4wjs:  Asked  for clarification  and  sent  a CAT  trace  version
    	   instructions to reproduce one issue for analysis - awaiting
    	   log.

Log directory - several - Difficulty locating log files

    g4wjs: A  new menu item  to open the  log directory in  a suitable
    	   system application would seem to satisfy these issues.

    g4wjs: Due to  the number of queries/requests  around locating the
    	   log files, this  has been added to the wsjtx-1.4.   It is a
    	   new  feature   rather  than  a   bug  fix  but   since  the
    	   implementation  is  fairly  trivial and  easily  tested  it
    	   shouldn't cause regressions.

    g4wjs: Completed r4470 - Closed.

Worked B4 - Peter oz1pif - Request option to use wsjtx.log as source

    g4wjs: He  deletes the ADIF  log after importing into  his logging
    	   application so the  ADIF log is not suitable  for worked B4
    	   checking. OTOH the wsjtx.log is  left untouched as a backup
    	   and would make a better database of worked calls.

    g4wjs: IMHO the worked B4 would  benefit from using a database for
    	   record storage  rather than using  a raw ADIF  format file.
    	   Whether   this  effort   is   justified   along  with   the
    	   installation  complexities  of  using a  portable  database
    	   application is hard  to judge.  Given that  JTAlert-X is so
    	   competent  at doing  this job  and more  on Windows;  maybe
    	   Laurie vk3ama might be persuaded to port his application to
    	   Linux and Mac  with bridges to logging  suites available on
    	   those platforms.

Settings dialog - Bob wd6dod - Widgets on Radio tab missing

    g4wjs: looks  like the default  and minimum sizes for  this window
    	   are too small and on some systems the layout doesn't render
    	   everything until the window is made larger.

    g4wjs: Fixed in r4481. Closed.

Hamlib IC-7800 - Dave g3red - Fails to initialize

    g4wjs: Sent tracing version of RC2 - awaiting log.

Virus detected - Bob kf5tpq - Vipre scanner detects trojan

    g4wjs:  This is  a  false  positive, but  for  releases we  should
    	   validate with  a few of  the on line  anti-virus validators
    	   and  publish  the  results  and  signatures  alongside  the
    	   releases.

    g4wjs: Asked  kf5tpq if  he went ahead  and installed  and offered
    	   more help if he is still unsure.

    g4wjs: Todo release process.

HRD FlexRadio-3000 (PowerSDR) - Johan ON3VNA - Illegal mode in init

    g4wjs: Asked for HRD info file - awaiting.

Log file - Albert kc8kjf - Callsign recorded as RRR

    g4wjs: Asked for ALL.txt to see which exchange caused this.
