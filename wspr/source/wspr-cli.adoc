Some special-purpose applications can benefit from a simple implementation of
the WSPR protocol in a program driven from the command line.  The standard _{prog}_
4.0 distribution includes a simple program “wspr0” for this purpose.  As
distributed, *wspr0* always uses the system default audio devices and it does not
implement automatic uploading of spots, rig control, *I/Q mode*, or *band hopping*.
The program runs in a single thread. Its source code is easy to modify as 
desired for particular  applications. Full operational details are described
in an accompanying document, {wspr0_guide}.
