I don’t see any _WSPR_ signals in the waterfall spectrogram. What solutions can I try to remedy this?::

. Is the Idle box is unchecked? 
. Have you selected the correct Audio in device in the Station parameters 
dialog? 
. Is audio reaching the computer? 
. The Rx Noise level displayed at bottom left of the WSPR window during a 
reception period should be at least –10 dB. If it is very low, e.g. –30 dB, you 
might need to adjust the volume level in your computer operating system 
and/or receiver. 
. Are any stations active on the selected band? For new users, 30 m is a good 
starting band as it generally has high activity and good propagation. Check 
the WSPRnet Activity page http://wsprnet.org/drupal/wsprnet/activity to see 
how many stations are active on a band, and where they are located. 
. Is your receiver is on the correct frequency and in USB mode? The readout 
frequency should be the one given in the Dial box. Use a standard-frequency 
signal such as WWV to determine your receiver's calibration accuracy and 
then, if necessary, adjust the receiver dial frequency accordingly. 

Now I see WSPR traces in the spectrogram but no decodes. What should I try now?::

. Reboot your computer. When it has rebooted, see if WSPR is working before 
starting any other programs. 
. Is your computer clock is set accurately enough? WSPR’s time readout 
should be within about ±1 second of the correct UTC. 
. Is your receiver drifting in frequency? If most WSPR traces slope either 
upward or downward in the spectrogram, the receiver is probably drifting too 
much. Try waiting half an hour to see if it stabilizes. 
. If you are transmitting, additional heat generated by the transmitter may 
contribute to the drift. Try reducing your output power or reducing Tx fraction 
so that you transmit less often.
