_{prog}_ 4.0 allows those with CAT-controlled radios to investigate propagation
on bands without user intervention.  Coordinated *hopping enables* a sizable group
of stations around the world to move together from band to band, thereby 
maximizing the chances of identifying open propagation paths.

Select *Band Hopping* on the Setup menu or type *F9*, and you'll see the screen
shown at left.  You can select any mix of active bands and Tx fractions.  If
you then check *Band Hop* in the main window, _{prog}_ will switch bands randomly
after each 2-minute interval.  If the box labeled *Tuneup* is checked for a
particular band, _{prog}_ will transmit an unmodulated carrier for several seconds
just after switching to that band and before the normal Rx or Tx period starts.
This feature can be used to activate an automatic antenna tuner (ATU) to tune a
multi-band antenna to the newly selected band.  Check the box *Coordinated hopping*
to enable sequential hopping through as many as ten bands, according to the 
schedule shown in the table below.

The band-selection schedule repeats starting at UTC minutes 20 and 40, for a
total of three full ten-band sequences in each hour.  If the designated band
for a given time slot has not been checked as active, a random choice is made
among the active bands.  The algorithm for choosing whether to receive or 
transmit guarantees at least one transmission on each active band every two
hours.  If all ten bands are active, up to three transmissions may be made on
a given band in a two hour period. 

Depending on your station and antenna setup, band changes might require other
switching besides retuning your radio.  To make this possible in an automated
way, whenever _{prog}_ executes a successful band-change command to a CAT-controlled
radio, it looks for a file named user_hardware.bat, user_hardware.cmd, 
user_hardware.exe, or user_hardware in the working directory.  If one of these
is found, _{prog}_ tries to execute the command

 user_hardware nnn
 
where *nnn* is the band-designation wavelength in meters.  You will need to write
your own program, script, or batch file to do the necessary switching at your
station.  I wrote a simple Python program for this purpose.  One of my antennas
is an all-band dipole fed with open-wire line through a 4:1 current balun and
an automatic ATU.  Other antennas include a shunt-fed tower for 160 m and a 
tri-band trap dipole for 20, 15, and 10 m.  The desired antenna is selected
automatically, by band.  When the all-band dipole is selected, the ATU adjusts
itself during the several seconds just before a transmission or reception period
begins.
