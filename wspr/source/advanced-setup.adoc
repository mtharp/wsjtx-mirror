The *Advanced* dialog can be called up from the *Setup* menu or by typing *F7*.
If your licensing authority requires callsign identification in Morse code at
specified intervals, you may set the interval in the *CW ID* field.  Your 
callsign will then be sent in CW at the end of WSPR transmissions, at the
specified interval. Because CW at 25 wpm uses several times more bandwidth
than a WSPR signal, it is strongly recommended that you not use the *CW ID*
feature unless required to
do so.

Users of homebrew receiving equipment may require a different BFO frequency than
the standard 1500 Hz used for SSB transceivers.  You can enter a nonstandard
value in the field labeled *Rx BFO (Hz)*.


Many modern transceivers use a master oscillator from which most other 
frequencies are synthesized.  If the master oscillator is slightly off 
frequency, all dial readings may be high or low in a predictable way.  
<<FREQCAL,Appendix C>> outlines a simple procedure for determining whether
your radio can be calibrated in this way, and if so how to determine the
calibration constants *A* and *B*.  Then, if you are using CAT control, you can
improve the accuracy of your transmitted and received frequencies by entering
these values and checking *Enable frequency correction* on the Advanced setup
screen.  Frequencies sent to the radio will then be adjusted according to your
calibration constants.  The button labeled *Measure an audio* frequency may be
useful in determining values for *A* and *B*.  See <<FREQCAL,Appendix C>> for
details. If using CAT control, you can force a frequency-setting command by
clicking *Update rig frequency*.

=== TX Audio Level

As shown in the screen shot above, a slider control allows you to reduce your
Tx audio signal by a specified amount.  The normal setting for full output is
0 dB (slider all the way to the right).  You can reduce power by up to 30 dB by
moving the slider to the left.  Changes take effect at the start of the next
transmission.  It may be convenient to adjust this slider by setting *Tx 
fraction* to 100% and clicking the *Tune* button to produce a series of transmitted
dashes.  Each dash will then reflect any new slider setting.
