- The *Advanced* dialog can be called up from the *Setup* menu or by
typing *F7*.  As shown in the screen shot below, a slider control
allows you to reduce your Tx audio signal by a specified amount.  The
normal setting for full output is 0 dB (slider all the way to the
right).  You can reduce power by up to 30 dB by moving the slider to
the left.  Changes take effect at the start of the next transmission.
It may be convenient to adjust this slider by setting *Tx fraction* to
100% and clicking the *Tune* button to produce a series of transmitted
dashes.  Each dash will then reflect any new slider setting.

- If your licensing authority requires callsign identification in
Morse code at specified intervals, you may set the interval in the *CW
ID (min)* field.  Your callsign will then be sent in CW at the end of
WSPR transmissions, at the specified interval. Because CW at 25 wpm
uses several times more bandwidth than a WSPR signal, it is strongly
recommended that you not use the *CW ID* feature unless required to do
so.

- Users of homebrew receiving equipment may require a different BFO
frequency than the standard 1500 Hz used for SSB transceivers.  You
can enter a nonstandard value in the field labeled *Rx BFO (Hz)*.

- Many modern transceivers use a master oscillator from which most
other frequencies are synthesized.  If the master oscillator is
slightly off frequency, all dial readings may be high or low in a
predictable way.  <<FREQCAL,Appendix C>> outlines a simple procedure
for determining whether your radio can be calibrated in this way, and
if so how to determine the calibration constants *A* and *B*.  Then,
if you are using CAT control, you can improve the accuracy of your
transmitted and received frequencies by entering these values and
checking *Enable frequency correction* on the *Advanced* setup screen.
Frequencies sent to the radio will then be adjusted according to your
calibration constants.  The button labeled *Measure an audio*
frequency may be useful in determining values for *A* and *B*.  See
<<FREQCAL,Appendix C>> for details. If using CAT control, you can
force a frequency-setting command by clicking *Update rig frequency*.
