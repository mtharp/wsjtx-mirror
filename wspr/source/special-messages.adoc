Normal _{prog}_ messages consist of a callsign, 4-digit grid locator, and power
level in dBm.  These messages are always preferred when appropriate.  However,
compound callsigns (i.e., callsigns with add-on prefix or suffix) cannot fit 
into the 28 bits allocated in a standard message.  Similarly, 6-digit locators
cannot fit into 15 bits.  Messages using these components are therefore sent 
using a two-transmission sequence.  For example, if the callsign is PJ4/K1ABC,
the 6-digit grid locator is FK52UD, and the power level 37 dBm, the following
messages will be sent in alternating transmissions:

 PJ4/K1ABC 37 
 <PJ4/K1ABC> FK52UD 37

If you have special need to use a 6-digit locator with a normal callsign, check
the box *Force transmission of 6-digit locator*.  If the callsign is K1ABC, the
6-digit grid locator FN42AX, and the power level 37 dBm, the following messages
will then be sent in alternating transmissions:

 K1ABC FN42 37 
 <K1ABC> FN42AX 37

Callsigns enclosed in angle brackets are actually sent as 15-bit hash codes.
If such a code is received by another station before the full callsign has been
received, it will be displayed as <...> on the decoded text line.  Once the full
callsign has been received, the decoder will thereafter recognize the hash code
and fill in the blanks.  Two very different callsigns might have the same hash
code, but the 15-bit hash-code length ensures that in practice such collisions
will be rare.
