The following steps should get you on the air quickly with _WSPR_.

1. Connect appropriate interface cables between radio and computer. For help with the hardware interface, refer to one of the many HowTo’s for sound card modes, for example http://www.w5bbr.com/soundbd.html. In general, you will need to connect the radio’s audio output to the computer’s soundcard input; for receive-only systems, that’s all you need! If you will also be transmitting you must patch soundcard output to the radio’s microphone or data input. For T/R switching and CAT control you may need a serial data cable or cables.

2. Start _WSPR_ by double-clicking on its desktop icon or another method of your choice. On the Setup | Station parameters dialog screen enter your callsign and 6-digit grid locator, select audio input and output devices, and select your transmitter power in dBm. (See Appendix A for a Watts-to-dBm conversion table.) Use the nearest value from the drop-down list. SWLs should provide a unique identifier (up to 8 characters) in place of a callsign.

3. If you choose to transmit as well as receive, _WSPR_ will control your T/R sequencing. Select the desired PTT method (DTR, RTS, CAT, or VOX). For DTR- or RTS-controlled switching, select a PTT port. For receive-only or VOX-controlled systems, set PTT port to None.

4. _WSPR_ offers limited CAT control of your transceiver, usable for T/R switching and frequency setting. To use this feature check Enable CAT and fill in the remaining parameters on the Station parameters screen. Consult the manual for your radio to determine necessary parameter values for the serial connection.

5. You may confirm proper operation of the WSPR decoder by opening a
sample audio file recorded by WSPR. Select File | Open, navigate to the
...\save\Samples directory under the installation directory, and open the file 091022_0436.wav. A total of six WSPR signals should be decoded, and your screen should look like the image on the next page. (You might find it interesting to listen to the sample file using Windows Sound Recorder or a similar utility program. The WSPR signals are barely audible, if audible at all, and the recording includes many atmospheric static crashes... and yet _WSPR_ decodes the signals without errors.)

6. Select an operating band from the Band menu. The default _WSPR_ frequency will appear in the Dial frequency box. For example, you should see 10.138700 MHz for the 30 m band. Set your transceiver to this frequency in USB or a USB-based data mode. (If you enabled CAT control, the frequency setting should be automatic.) Select a desired Tx frequency by double-clicking somewhere in the graphical display area. Available Tx frequencies fall in the range 1400–1600 Hz above the dial frequency. Clicking near the bottom of the graphical area gives a frequency near the lower limit, and clicking near the top puts you near the upper limit.

7. _WSPR_ uses two-minute time slots for transmitting and receiving. The slider labeled Tx fraction sets the average proportion of time allocated for transmitting. The default setting of 20% is a good compromise under typical conditions: it means that you will transmit approximately once every ten minutes and receive the rest of the time. The exact T/R sequence will be randomized so as to maximize your chances of receiving other WSPR stations. For receive-only operation, set the Tx fraction slider to zero.

8. While in Idle mode, you may click the Tune button to produce a short
unmodulated test transmission. Duration of the transmission (in seconds) is set by the Tx fraction slider.

9. Be sure that your computer clock is correct to within about ±1 second. Many
operators synchronize with an Internet time service and software such as
Dimension 4 for Windows, available at http://www.thinkman.com/dimension4/.
For Ubuntu Linux install ntp, select *System | Administration | Time and Date*,
choose a couple of time servers near you, and select Automatic
Synchronization.

10. If you have internet access and wish to upload your reports automatically to
{wsprnet}, check the box labeled Upload spots.

11. To begin normal operation, clear the Idle checkbox. _WSPR_ will then begin a
receive sequence at the start of the next even-numbered UTC minute. After
reception has started, use the computer’s sound mixer and/or the volume
controls on your radio or soundcard interface to adjust the audio level (lower
left corner of main _WSPR_ screen, see picture on next page) to about 0 dB. At
the end of each reception interval, the waterfall will update and any decoded
_WSPR_ transmissions will appear in the main text window.
