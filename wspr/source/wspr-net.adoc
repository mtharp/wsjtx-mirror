To access the features of WSPRnet, point your browser to {wsprnet}. This 
excellent site is designed and maintained by *Bruce Walker, W1BW*.  It provides
a chat facility, band-by-band counts of stations reporting _WSPR_ spots 
(or reported by others) in the past ten minutes, a world-wide map showing active
_{prog}_ stations and propagation paths, an interface to the historical database,
and statistical summaries derived from the data. The map can be zoomed and
panned, and you can set various criteria to determine which spots are shown.
An example of the world-wide map is shown below:
