This is a mirror of the WSJT-X subversion repository. (Almost) all branches and tags from svn are converted here on an hourly basis. The mirror is not officially sanctioned, but it might be useful for developers who are more comfortable with git.

You probably want to start with the "wsjtx" branch, although release branches (wsjtx-1.x) might be more stable.

**Pull requests will be ignored. Send patches to the wsjt-devel mailing list.**

The original SVN repo can be cloned from svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt
