2014-06-01 commit r4162 Greg Beam <ki7mt@yahoo.com>

* Update safe arm6v CFLAGS
* Flags tested with remote users
* Remove -m64, was an oversite leaving it in.
* Fix month num in change log.

2014-05-31 (2) commit r4161 Greg Beam <ki7mt@yahoo.com>

* Restored to original, removed tests.
* Debian build system warns about unused symbols, UBuntu 
  builds system automatically removes them. Tried several
  itterations but f2py will not accept -Wl, --as-needed,
  sees it as unknows flags.
* Current state builds on: Debian sid 32/64, Ubuntu trusy 32/64
  and saucy 32/64
* The messages from Debian build server are just notifications.

2014-05-31 (1) commit r4161 Greg Beam <ki7mt@yahoo.com>

* More flag updates for configure.ac and Makfile.in
* Previous commits added limited support for armv6 (RaspberryPi) based
  on Debian Wheezy. It wont run WSPR GUI, due to package limitations
  surrounding Pillow, but wspr0 and the FMT tools are fine.
* Previous commits also added support for cases $host_os, then further, down into
  $host_cpu for Linux. Hopefully this solves the the issues for both i386 and
  Mac OSX surround -m64.
* Removed uneeded -pthread links where symbols weren't being used. Resolves
  some chroot / bootstrap build warnings.
* Removed the stub target as we need fflags for Mac anyway
  so wanrings of unused vars is back but, they are not hurting anything.

2014-05-17 commit r4146 Greg Beam <ki7mt@yahoo.com>

* Fixed typo's in configure.ac + minor edits
* Minor edits & updates to wspr-dist.sh
* Added make dist: target to Makfile.in

  Requires: bash and readlink

  [USAGE]
  ./autogen.sh
  make dist
  
  Creates: ../wspr/dist/WSPR-4.0-linux.tar.gz
  
  Name and version are taken from @PROGRAM@ and @VERSION@, which is
  set in configure.ac header. If you want to change the filename,
  call the script directly from a shell.

  Note: After running make dist, you will need to run
  autogen.sh again, as make dist performs a distclean before
  building the tar.gz file, just in case something slips by.
  
  
2014-05-17 commit r4145 Greg Beam <ki7mt@yahoo.com>

For Python3 and / or f2py:

Example:

2014-05-15 commit r4144 Greg Beam <ki7mt@yahoo.com>

  warning messages during build.


2014-05-14 (2) Greg Beam <ki7mt@yahoo.com>

* Generate Makefile, even though configure fails.
* Add indicators as to what failed in Make Summary.


2014-05-14 (1) Greg Beam <ki7mt@yahoo.com>

* Added WSJT site info to makefile.in & configure.ac
* Added additional LDFLAG locations if found. This
  may help with odd system configurations.
* Fixed several bad path vars that may have been
  causing issues finding Libs.


2014-05-13 (3) Greg Beam <ki7mt@yahoo.com>

* change makefile in, yet again, to try an resolve ${MVSO}
  as w*.so does not work. w.*.so is ok, as is w.so for Mac.
  there are several ways of doing this.
* More updates to wspr-dist.sh
* Updated INSTALL.TXT


2014-05-13 (2) Greg Beam <ki7mt@yahoo.com>

  regaurding ${MV} := w*.so v.s. w.*.so

2014-05-13 (1) Greg Beam <ki7mt@yahoo.com>

* fix a potential issue with Makefile.in FC v.s.FCV
* Add wspr-dist.sh script to build tar.gz file
* add manifest file for use wiht wspr-dist.sh


2014-05-12 Greg Beam <ki7mt@yahoo.com>

* Added simplle install / uninstall targets
* Users should *NOT* install to /usr/local because
  Coreutils installs a program named "fmt", a command
  line text formating tool, and WSPR also has a program called
  "fmt", used for callibration and running the ARRL FMT tests.

  Until this is resolved, it's recommended to install to
  the users home directories $HOME/wspr, which is the default
  set in configure.ac.

* Additionally, to run WSPR from /usr/local, we need a wspr.sh
  script (same as WSJT uses), which can be automated during
  make to account for python3 locations ++ user --prefix selections.
  
* TO BUILD && INSTALL

- svn checkout ../wspr
- ./autogen.sh
- make && make install

  by default: WSPR installs in $HOME/wspr
  
* UNINSTALL

- make uninstall

- Removes the WSPR directory. If the user created prefix folders
  ($HOME/testing/wspr), for safety reason, uninstall will not
  remove "../testing, only ../testing/wspr which is set in the
  Makefile as ${PREFIX}
