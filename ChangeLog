Current Development Version: WSPR-4.0


2014-04-13 (3) Greg Beam <ki7mt@yahoo.com>

* change makefile in, yet again, to try an resolve ${MVSO}
  as w*.so does not work. w.*.so is ok, as is w.so for Mac.
  there are several ways of doing this.
* More updates to wspr-dist.sh
* Updated INSTALL.TXT


2014-04-13 (2) Greg Beam <ki7mt@yahoo.com>

* Updated Makefile.in based on feedback from Chuck WA7KGX
  regaurding ${MV} := w*.so v.s. w.*.so
* Added PROGRAM and VERSION configure.ac and Makefile.in
* Added build-aux/ to wspr-dist.sh
* Updated README in /wspr/doc/man1 (AsciiDoc Tips)
* Updated autogen.sh for additional checks


2014-04-13 (1) Greg Beam <ki7mt@yahoo.com>

* fix a potential issue with Makefile.in FC v.s.FCV
* Add wspr-dist.sh script to build tar.gz file
* add manifest file for use wiht wspr-dist.sh


2014-04-12 Greg Beam <ki7mt@yahoo.com>

* Added simplle install / uninstall targets
* Users should *NOT* install to /usr/local because
  Coreutils installs a program named "fmt", a command
  line text formating tool, and WSPR also has a program called
  "fmt", used for callibration and running the ARRL FMT tests.

  Until this is resolved, it's recommended to install to
  the users home directories $HOME/wspr, which is the default
  set in configure.ac.

* Additionally, to run WSPR from /usr/local, we need a wspr.sh
  script (same as WSJT uses), which can be automated during
  make to account for python3 locations ++ user --prefix selections.
  
* TO BUILD && INSTALL

- svn checkout ../wspr
- ./autogen.sh
- make && make install

  by default: WSPR installs in $HOME/wspr
  
* UNINSTALL

- make uninstall

- Removes the WSPR directory. If the user created prefix folders
  ($HOME/testing/wspr), for safety reason, uninstall will not
  remove "../testing, only ../testing/wspr which is set in the
  Makefile as ${PREFIX}
