= WSJT Documentation Change Log

== TO-DO:
* Add provision to build Manpages without installing half the Ubuntu
  repository to accomplish it, as it's not necessary (*Nix, Win32).
* Single build function for each type, html, manpage, data-uri. (*Nix, Win32)
* Build asciidoc.exe with Python27 base64 mime type support (Win32)
* Add Windows clean_up function to build.bat (Win32)


== Version 0.9.1
by KI7MT, <ki7mt@yahoo.com>

* Fixed BASDIR=$(exec pwd) as POSIX doesnt' like readlink (*Nix)
* added clean_up function, removes all $app_name/tmp & *.html files/folders (*Nix)
* updated help menu (*Nix)
* added version number to Windows script (*Nix)
* Tested a2x.exe on Wwindows, all passed (Win32)
* added wfmt (WSPR FMT) builds (*Nix, Win32)

. For clean_up: ./build-doc.sh clean (*Nix)

* NOTE:	Windows builds cannot buld data-uri due to the limited embedded Python
		intreputer in asciidoc.exe, basically, it needs base64 mime tpyes
		which were not compiled into the .exe. I've added to the to-do list.


== Version 0.9.0
by KI7MT, <ki7mt@yahoo.com>

* Only Affects Linux
* combined data-uri and build-doc scripts (*Nix)
* removed special WSJT-X build instruction (*Nix)
* added WSPR-FMT documentation (*Nix), needs updating
* changed build declaration for dev-guide and quick-ref
  to match windows:
  ./build-doc.sh devg .. or .. ./build-doc.sh qref
* removed Ask if you want to buld all documents
* removed short-list array. *build all* now builds all docs
* updated clean exit function
* updated trap signals
* convert dev-guide images from .jpg to .png
