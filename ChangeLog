* Only Affects Linux
* combined data-uri and build-doc scripts (Linux)
* removed special WSJT-X build instruction (Linux)
* added WSPR-FMT documentation (Linux), needs updating
* changed build declaration for dev-guide and quick-ref
  to match windows:
  ./build-doc.sh devg .. or .. ./build-doc.sh qref
* removed Ask if you want to buld all documents
* removed short-list array. *build all* now builds all docs
* updated clean exit function
* updated trap signals
* convert dev-guide images from .jpg to .png

TO-DO:
* Add provision to build Manpages without installing half the Ubuntu
  repository to accomplish it, as it's not necessary.
* Single build function for each type, html, manpage, data-uri
