New release of of experimental WSJT-X v1.6.1, r5789

Changes since WSJT-X v1.6.1, revision 5779:

1.  Major speedup (5x) of fast-JT9 decoder.
2.  Corrected logic for Auto-Sequencing operation.
3.  Stop after sending 73 five times in auto-sequence mode.
4.  Add an "Auto-Level" control to Fast Graph window.
5.  Send fast-mode decodes to PSKreporter web site.
6.  Support automatic logging via JTAlert-X.
7.  Send fast-mode output to file ALL.TXT.
8.  Better definition of dB levels for fast-JT9 signals.
9.  Rationalize the GUI behavior when changing mode, submode, fast/slow
    status, and T/R period.
10. Correct a flaw in the display of multiple decodes in a single 
    fast-JT9 sequence.
11. Fix minor bugs reported by G3WDG, ND0B, OZ1PIF, and others.

Since its origin in the dark ages (ca. 2001) WSJT has supported "fast"
modes (designed for meteor scatter, etc.) and "slow" modes (optimized
for EME and other weak-signal propagation types).  The most recent new
mode, JT9, now has *both* fast and slow submodes.  

JT9A (the "original" JT9) is like JT65 and JT4: its T/R sequences are
one minute long, and its primary goal is best possible sensitivity for
very weak, approximately steady signals.  The new experimental JT9
submodes use the same message structure, encoding, and modulation type
(9-tone FSK) as JT9A, but wider tone spacing and (optionally) faster
keying rates.

You can download an experimental version of WSJT-X (v1.6.1, r5779) here:
http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx-1.6.1-r5779-win32.exe

The fast submodes currently being tested, JT9E - JT9H, have been found
highly effective for meteors and ionoscatter propagation on 6 and 10
meters.  Sensitivity is similar to ISCAT, or slightly better.
Decoding is much more reliable, because the JT9 protocol includes
strong forward error correction.  Decoding results are like those for
all the WSJT "slow" modes: you should see messages exactly as they
were transmitted, or nothing at all.  A potential side benefit is
automatic reporting of decodes to PSKreporter.

For details on the modulation parameters of the JT9 submodes, see the
table posted at
http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjt_modes.txt.

WSJT-X v1.6.1 r5779 has the following changes from r5769:

1. Numerous bug fixes
2. Double-click on decoded message now behaves properly
3. Faster decoding (further optimization still to come)
4. Decoded text is highlighted as in WSJT-X slow modes
5. Optional auto-sequencing

Fair warning: auto-sequencing is basically functional, but scarcely
tested.  Please watch what it is doing, and tell us how you think it
should be improved!

If you use WSJT-X also for other modes and other purposes, you may
want to save several different sets of configuration settings.  In
that case it's convenient to use the "-r xxx" option and start the
program from a command-prompt window.  For example:

C:\Users\joe> cd \wsjt\wsjtx\bin
C:\WSJT\wsjtx\bin> wsjtx -r xxx

... where "xxx" can be anything you like, for example "ISCAT",
"FAST9", etc.

Proper configuration for the JT9 fast modes includes the following
settings:

On the Settings | General tab:

 - check "Enable VHF/UHF/Microwave features"

Main window settings:

 - Mode JT9
 - Tx 700 Hz
 - Rx 700 Hz
 - Sync 0
 - Submode G  ... or E, F, and H (H not legal in US on 10m)
 - Tick "Fast"
 - T/R 30 s     (also 5, 10, 15 s)
 - FTol 500

Please keep in mind that this is an experimental version of WSJT-X.
It still has some rough edges, and no doubt some bugs.  Your feedback
will be much appreciated, and will help to make the program better!
