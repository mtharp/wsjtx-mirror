This experimental version of WSJT-X introduces a new fast mode called
JTMSK.  The letters MS, of course, imply meteor scatter; the three
letters MSK mean "Minimum Shift Keying", the modulation scheme used in
this mode.

Revision 5823 also includes a number of (mostly minor) bug fixes
relative to r5789.

IMPORTANT: If you choose to try JTMSK, please accept the
responsibility of reporting on your results.  You can send reports to
the "wsjtgroup" reflector, wsjtgroup@yahoogroups.com or email them
directly to me.  All suggestions for improvements are welcome!  Bug
reports should include details on how to reproduce the undesirable
program behavior.

The present JTMSK decoder has been optimized for short pings.  It does
not yet do a wide search for proper frequency alignment; you and your
QSO partner need to be "on frequency" to within +/- 100 Hz or better.
The decoder does not (yet) attempt to make optimal use of weak, slowly
varying signals.  These and other characteristics may be improved in
coming revisions.

KNOWN BUG: At present you should use T/R sequence lengths 15 s in
JTMSK mode.  If you have a program crash, open Windows Task Manager,
select the "Processes" tab, right-click on wsjtx.exe, and select "End
Process Tree".  Then restart the program.

I view JTMSK as a candidate for replacing both FSK441 and JTMS for all
meteor scatter work.  JTMSK has the major advantage of including
strong forward error correction (FEC), similar in usage to the schemes
used for many years in JT4, JT9, and JT65.  The structure of user
messages and the format of minimal QSOs is also identical to those
other modes.  But JTMSK is very fast, transmitting its full encoded
message content in 0.117 s, in a 2 kHz bandwidth.  JTMSK therefore
makes much better use of short pings than (for example) JT9H can do.

The Tx waveform of JTMSK has been carefully designed to have a number
of desirable features.  All messages are exactly the same length: 72
bits of user information are followed by a 15-bit CRC and encoded into
198 channel bits with a convolutional code (constraint length K=13,
rate r=1/2).  Three sequences of the "Barker-11" code are added, along
with three parity bits, making a total of 234 channel bits in each
message.  The MSK symbols for these bits are transmitted at 2000 baud,
and the full encoded message is repeated every 117 ms.

A summary description of modulation parameters for all WSJT(-X) modes
is shown in a table posted here:
http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjt_modes.txt and
illustrated graphically here:

New release of experimental WSJT-X v1.6.1, r5789

Changes since WSJT-X v1.6.1, revision 5779:

1.  Major speedup (5x) of fast-JT9 decoder.
2.  Corrected logic for Auto-Sequencing operation.
3.  Stop after sending 73 five times in auto-sequence mode.

6.  Support automatic logging via JTAlert-X.
7.  Send fast-mode output to file ALL.TXT.
8.  Better definition of dB levels for fast-JT9 signals.
9.  Rationalize the GUI behavior when changing mode, submode, fast/slow
    status, and T/R period.
10. Correct a flaw in the display of multiple decodes in a single 
    fast-JT9 sequence.
11. Fix minor bugs reported by G3WDG, ND0B, OZ1PIF, and others.

Since its origin in the dark ages (ca. 2001) WSJT has supported "fast"
modes (designed for meteor scatter, etc.) and "slow" modes (optimized
for EME and other weak-signal propagation types).  The most recent new
mode, JT9, now has *both* fast and slow submodes.  

JT9A (the "original" JT9) is like JT65 and JT4: its T/R sequences are
one minute long, and its primary goal is best possible sensitivity for
very weak, approximately steady signals.  The new experimental JT9
submodes use the same message structure, encoding, and modulation type
(9-tone FSK) as JT9A, but wider tone spacing and (optionally) faster
keying rates.

You can download an experimental version of WSJT-X (v1.6.1, r5779) here:
http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx-1.6.1-r5779-win32.exe

The fast submodes currently being tested, JT9E - JT9H, have been found
highly effective for meteors and ionoscatter propagation on 6 and 10
meters.  Sensitivity is similar to ISCAT, or slightly better.
Decoding is much more reliable, because the JT9 protocol includes
strong forward error correction.  Decoding results are like those for
all the WSJT "slow" modes: you should see messages exactly as they
were transmitted, or nothing at all.  A potential side benefit is
automatic reporting of decodes to PSKreporter.

For details on the modulation parameters of the JT9 submodes, see the
table posted at
http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjt_modes.txt.

WSJT-X v1.6.1 r5779 has the following changes from r5769:

1. Numerous bug fixes
2. Double-click on decoded message now behaves properly
3. Faster decoding (further optimization still to come)
4. Decoded text is highlighted as in WSJT-X slow modes
5. Optional auto-sequencing

Fair warning: auto-sequencing is basically functional, but scarcely
tested.  Please watch what it is doing, and tell us how you think it
should be improved!

If you use WSJT-X also for other modes and other purposes, you may
want to save several different sets of configuration settings.  In
that case it's convenient to use the "-r xxx" option and start the
program from a command-prompt window.  For example:

C:\Users\joe> cd \wsjt\wsjtx\bin
C:\WSJT\wsjtx\bin> wsjtx -r xxx

... where "xxx" can be anything you like, for example "ISCAT",
"FAST9", etc.

Proper configuration for the JT9 fast modes includes the following
settings:

On the Settings | General tab:

 - check "Enable VHF/UHF/Microwave features"

Main window settings:

 - Mode JT9
 - Tx 700 Hz
 - Rx 700 Hz
 - Sync 0
 - Submode G  ... or E, F, and H (H not legal in US on 10m)
 - Tick "Fast"
 - T/R 30 s     (also 5, 10, 15 s)
 - FTol 500

Please keep in mind that this is an experimental version of WSJT-X.
It still has some rough edges, and no doubt some bugs.  Your feedback
will be much appreciated, and will help to make the program better!
