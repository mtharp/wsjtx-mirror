_WSPR-X_ is an experimental version of WSPR that offers an optional slow mode with 15-minute T/R sequences and 9 dB better sensitivity than the normal 2-minute mode. Version 0.7 of _WSPR-X_ does not support I/Q audio (for use with direct conversion receivers and tranceivers) and is unable to “band hop.” This release is primarily intended to facilitate experimentation with the “WSPR-15” mode on the MF and LF bands. For background information and a full description of the WSPR protocol, see the _WSPR 3.O User Guide_. This brief document should help you get started with _WSPR-X_. It assumes that you are familiar with previous versions of _WSPR_.
