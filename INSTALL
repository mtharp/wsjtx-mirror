Installation Instructions for WSPR 4.0
--------------------------------------

The following is a brief installation guide using Linux as the example. WSPR
can be built on Windows (using MinGW+MSYS / JTSDK-PY), and on Mac OSX 10.6/7
using the repsective Makefile.


BASIC LINUX INSTRUCTIONS: (Linux Example x86_64 System):
-----------------------------------------------------------
To compile WSPR, as a minimum, you will need the following:

	* A C, C++ and gfortran compiler.
	  The GNU Tool chaines tested: 4.8.1/2. 4.9.x has not been tested
	* GNU Autotools: autoconf, make, libtool
	* Portaudio-19
	* FFTW 3.3+
	* Samplerate Library.
	* Python3.2+
	* Numeric Python (F2PY-3.2+)
	* PIL, (Python Imaging Library)
	* Tcl\TK (8.6.1 or Later)
	* Hamlib 1.2.15.3+ (If rig control is desired)

NOTE: Where possible, install dev / header packages.

The default install location is /usr/local, however, you can run WSPR
from the source tree after make. You can also change the install target
locaiton using the following configure parameter:

--prefix=/desired/install/path

You will also need a paths to Portaudio Libs and Lib-Dir if not picked up
by the configure script:

--with-portaudio-lib-dir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
--with-portaudio-include-dir=/usr/include

On dual python systems, you need to specify Python3+ and F2PY3+ locations:

PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
F2PY=/usr/local/bin/f2py3

To see a full list of options,use: ./configure --help


CONFIGURE && MAKE (x86_64 *Nix System)
--------------------------------------

	autoconf
	./configure --with-portaudio-lib-dir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu \
	--with-portaudio-include-dir=/usr/include \
	PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3 \
	F2PY=/usr/local/bin/f2py3
	

At this point, you can run WSPR from the source tree with:

python3 -O wspr.py


FINAL MAKE INSTALL
------------------

To install WSPR into system directories (for all users)

Note: you need root or RootSudo for this step:

sudo make install

or

root make install


CLEAN BUILD TREE:
-----------------
make clean

CLEAN FOR DISTRIBUTION:
-----------------------
make distclean
