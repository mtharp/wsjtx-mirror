WSJT-X Installation
===================

To build WSJT-X you need some prerequisite tools and libraries.

On Linux:

   build-essentials
   gcc-4.8.2 or clang-3.4
   g++-4.8.2 or clang-3.4
   gfortran-4.8.2
   CMake-2.8.9
   git
   svn

   Qt5.2.1 or newer libmultimedia-dev and its prerequisites
   libfftw3-single-dev and its prerequsites
   libusb-0.1-dev

Out of source builds are stringly recommended.

Create a  build directory somewhere  and cd  to it then  configure the
build as follows:

    mkdir <build-dir-path>
    cd <build-dir-path>
    cmake <source-dir-path>

By default  the build will install  the application in '/usr',  if you
want to install it somewhere else e.g. under your own account, you can
specify   the    install   prefix   as   a    configuration   variable
(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX):

    cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.local <source-dir-path>

You may build  a specific version by specifying the  tag in the WSJT-X
repository  e.g. wsjtx-1.4.0-rc2  by specifying  it as  a variable  to
configure:

    cmake -D WSJTX_TAG=tags/wsjtx-1.4.0-rc2 <source-dir-path>

Once configured the package can be built as follows:

    cmake --build <build-dir-path>

If you  are a package maintainer  you can specify an  alternate target
that generates  a suitable package  for the  system you run  the build
on. It  is recommended  to to this  even if you  choose to  unwrap the
package to  adjust the  settings or contents  before building  a final
package. The alternate target is 'package' and is build as follows:

    cmake --build <build-dir-path> --target package

If the build  is successful the location of the  built package(s) will
be displayed at teh end of the output.

Other targets available include:

     hamlib   		- just build the hamlib intermediate library

     wsjtx-build	- stop after building WSJT-X

     wsjtx-install	- stop after installing WSJT-X
