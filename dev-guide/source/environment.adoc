[[BASE_ENV]]
Before you can start developing _WSJT_ applications, you must first 
set up your environment. The {page} will use the respective *JTSDK*
for Windows and +*JTSDK-NIX*+ and *WSJT-ENV* for Linux as the
containment area.

.The containment area will provide:
* A fixed structure to work from
* System independent build tools
* Produce repeatable results from application builds
* Create an experimental area to test builds
* Allow full testing without system installation
* Minimize the footprint v.s. Virtual Environments
* Provide build methods for non-developer testing

Software development kits are provided for Windows and Linux. Each kit
setup the environment described above. Details of each kit can be found
at the end of the dev-guide.

.NOTES
* Each kit is self contained, you should not have to install
any system level software.
* All 5 main stream applications +*( WSJT, WSJT-X, WSPR, WSPR-X and MAP65 )+*
can be build using the appropriate SDK.
* If you already have the packages installed, the SDK will not interfere
with your System Paths or use System Applications to perform builds.

.JTSDK-DOC
* +*JTSDK-DOC*+ contains: Subversion, GNU Tools and scripts to build
all +*WSJT Documentation.*+.
* For details, see <<JTSDKDOC,JTSDK-DOC>>.

.JTSDK-DOC Main Menu

.JTSDK-PY
* +*JTSDK-PY*+ contains Python3 ({plus} modules}, Subversion, GNU Tools
and scripts required to build +*WSJT*+ and +*WSPR*+.
* For details, see
<<JTSDKDOC,JTSDK-PY>>.

.JTSDK-PY Main Menu

.JTSDK-QT
* +*JTSDK-QT*+ contains QT5, CMake, Subversion, FFTW3, GNU Tools, 
hamlib-1.2, Hamlib-3 and scripts to build +*WSJT-X*+, +*WSPR-X*+ and
+*MAP65*+.
* For details, see <<JTSDKDOC,JTSDK-QT>>.

.JTSDK-QT Main Menu

.JTSDK-NIX
* Provides QT5, Python3 ({plus} modules), libraries and dependencies.
* For details, see <<JTSDKNIX,JTSDK-NIX>>.

[[PATHCFG]]
=== Path Configuration 

The {page} will use the respective SDK, and thus the following
paths throughout:

* +*WINDOWS*+
- Scripts, builds and package installations will be in:
- C:\JTSDK-DOC
- C:\JTSDK-PY
- C:\JTSDK-QT

//	

* +*LINUX*+
- JTSDK-NIX
- /opt/jtsdk-nix

// 

- Scripts, builds and package installations will be in:
- /home/$USER/wsjt-env


IMPORTANT: If you choose to install an SDK in a different location
from the recommendation, you will need to reconfigure it, basically
rebuild the SDK from scratch in order to maintain the proper relative
paths.

[[WINBASESETUP]]
== Windows SDK

Setup and installation is straight forward. The .EXE files are self
extracting 7z compressed files. We will use +*JTSDK-DOC*+ as the
example, but all three SDKs use the exact same process.

=== Download

Download one or all of the following:

[horizontal]
+*JTSDK-DOC*+:: {jtsdk_doc}
+*JTSDK-PY*+:: {jtsdk_py}
+*JTSDK-QT*+:: {jtsdk_qt}

=== Installation
* Double Click or Right Click and Open the download
* Change path to: C:\
* Click the Extract Button

image::images/7z-extract.png[]

* Browse to C:\JTSDK-*
* Open the env batch file
** For JTSDK-DOC, +*jtsdk-docenv.bat*+
** For JTSDK-PY, +*jtsdk-pyenv.bat*+
** For JTSDK-QT, +*jtsdk-qtenv.bat*+
* Follow the instructions for SVN checkout

=== Uninstall
* Delete C:\JTSDK-DOC -PY or -QT
* Nothing is installed to the system or registry
