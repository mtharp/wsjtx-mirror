[[BASE_ENV]]
As a developer, one knows, there are many ways in which to set-up for 
developing a particular application. *JTSDK* employs a structured 
environment in order to produce repeatable results. All build scripts are
written to work with the *JTSDK* install locations. Modification of the scripts
is possible, but would entail a great deal of re-work.

If the user wants to build applications manually, the environment scripts,
(on Windows) provide the correct paths to all the required libraries and GCC
tool chains. Building outside of the environment is possible, but would require
setting the correct paths and ensuring system wide installation of the same or
similar tools do not conflict one another.

On Linux, most, if not all of the required dependencies, are installed to system
folder locations. If you installed *JTSDK* from the configure scripts, no 
additional configuration should be required.

*****
WARNING: The *JTSDK* install location ( on Windows ) is fixed due to the fact
Python3 and Qt5 have been previously installed, or in the case of Python3
modules, built with a specific file / folder location. While it is possible to
rebase both Python3 and Qt5, there is a risk of module failure in doing so. If
your planning on changing the install location, all of the build and support
scripts will need to be changed. It is highly advisable to leave the
default installation location as is.

.Windows Folder Locations
[horizontal]
*Install Location*:: C:\JTSDK
*Source Directory*:: C:\JTSDK\src
*App Install Location*:: C:\JTSDK\(app name)
*Libraries*:: C:\JTSDK\(library name)
*Environments*:: C:\JTSDK\(Cyg32,MSYS)

.Linux FOlder Locations

*Install Location*:: /usr/local/bin

*App Install Location*:: /home/$USER/jtsdk/(app name)
*Libraries*:: Default System Location
*Environments*:: Default System

=== Windows Notes
*JTSDK* for Windows provides the containment and all required tools to build a
fully working application or the sub-targets if desired. Details of each kit can
be found in the appropriate appendix. With the exception of prerequisite 
packages, none of the packages within *JTSDK* should interfere with nor conflict
previously installed system packages.

.There are (4) primary environments
[horizontal]
<<JTSDKQT,JTSDK-QT>>:: used for building _WSJT-X_, _WSPR-X_ and _MAP65_
<<JTSDKPY,JTSDK-PY>>:: used for building _WSJT_ and _WSPR_
<<JTSDKDOC,JTSDK-DOC>>:: used for building documentation
<<JTSDKMSYS,JTSDK-MSYS>>:: a general purpose autotools environment

Each of the environments are completely isolated from one another, both
in terms of compilers and support package paths. All (4) environments
are purpose built to provide the the correct configuration needed to build
their respective packages. While environments may be customized by the user,
care should be taken so as not to break the core configuration, in particular,
the support libraries and respective GCC tool chains. This is especially
important when dealing with Python3 modules that build _WSJT_ and _WSPR_ as they
are version and compiler specific.

=== Linux Notes
*JTSDK* for Linux places all builds and src folders within the users ($USER)
home directory. Unlike the Windows collection, Linux packaging is done by way
of the respective distribution package manager. The following distributions
are currently supported:

* Ubuntu; 14.04, 14.10
* Debian; 8.0*
* Mintl 17.1

As time allows, additional distributions will be added.

Rather than separate environments, *JTSDK* for Linux uses the same tool set the
users system would use. Builds are accomplished though a simple Dialog Ncurses
menu system rather than command line entry. With very few exceptions, default
distribution repository packages are used during the *JTSDK* installation
process.
