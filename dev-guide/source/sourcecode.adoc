All source code for the WSJT programs is available through an open-source
repository known as SourceForge, under control of the version-control
program {svn}. Subversion is included in both *JTSDKs*. There is no need to
install Subversion separately if you intend to build applications or
documentation using the *JTSDK*.

You can browse the organization of files in the repository {wsjt_svn}.
Code for program **_WSJT_** lies in the +trunk+ directory, while code for
the other programs is found in +.../branches/map65+,
+.../branches/wsjtx+, and +.../branches/wsprx+.  Various experimental
branches may also exist, and snapshots of code for certain released
program versions may be obtained from the +.../tags+ directory.

*****
WARNING: Please note: the HEAD of the SVN repository for any of these
programs is likely to be an active development branch.  There is no
guarantee that a build from every revision will be successful, nor
that it will provide a stable executable program.

=== Repository Layout
The source code on SourceForge uses a slightly modified version of the
traditional ( **_trunk, branches, tags_** ) setup. With the exception of
**_WSJT_**, all application source code resides in their respective branch.

* *Trunk* is normally the main body of development, originating from the start
of the project to present day. For the WSJT Project, the **_Trunk_** is where
the **_WSJT_** application source code resides.
* *Branch* would normally copy code from the trunk, apply major changes, add new
features, fix bugs etc. When the work is complete, the updated code is merged
back into the trunk. For all applications apart from **_WSJT and kvasd-installer_**,
the source code for the application in question resides within a branch, affectively
becoming the "Trunk" for particular application.
* *Tag* is a point in time when the trunk ( for **_WSJT_** ) or a branch ( for **_all_**
others ) reaches a release point, and the code it locked into a revision. Tagging
allows for preservation and quick retrieval. In affect, a Tag is nothing more
than a copy of the trunk or branch at a given point in the development cycle
a.k.a, the svn revision number ( **_rXXXX_** ).
* *Files* is a folder where Tags are converted to source tarballs and binary
packages for use by the general public.

=== Checkout Methods
There are two primary methods for checking out source code, <<ANONCO,Anonymous>>
and <<DEVCO,Developer>>. Additional checkouts are provided by way of
<<RC,Release Candidates>> and <<TAG,Tagged Releases>>.

[[ANONCO]]
=== Anonymous
Anonymous checkouts allow you to build all documentation and
applications using the same methods as the developers, however,
you cannot check-in your local updates to the repository.

Each *(SDK)* has short-cuts built-in for Anonymous check-outs. For example,
to checkout **_WSJT_** using **JTSDK-PY**, type:
-----
checkout-wsjt
-----

.Anonymous Source Code Locations (URLs):
[horizontal]
*WSJT*:: https://svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/trunk
*WSJT-X*:: https://svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/branches/wsjtx
*WSPR*:: https://svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/branches/wspr
*WSPR-X*:: https://svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/branches/wsprx
*MAP65*:: https://svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/branches/map65

//

[[DEVCO]]
=== Developer
In order to use the developer check-out or check-in process

* Create a {sourceforge} User Account
* Email {joe_taylor} to be added to the Developer List.

Then, using **_WSJT_** as the example:

---------
svn co https://user@svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/trunk 
---------

Substitute your SourceForge username for *user*.

TIP: Due to the variations in user names, developer check-out
short-cuts are not possible, and must be manually entered.

.Developer Checkout Locations (URLs):
[horizontal]
*WSJT*:: https://user@svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/trunk
*WSJT-X*:: https://user@svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/branches/wsjtx
*WSPR*:: https://user@svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/branches/wspr
*WSPR-X*:: https://user@svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/branches/wsprx
*MAP65*:: https://user@svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/branches/map65

[[RC]]
=== Release Candidates
Often, release candidates *(RC)* are provided for *Alpha* or *Beta* testing.
Where feasible, the *(SDK)* provides a method of build for each candidate.

The posted *(RC)* is tested against the *(SDK)* and should perform the
build correctly. Back-porting, due to the many variables involved,
is not possible at this time. If you need an older version of a
particular application, the best advice would be to use a previously
posted binary installer or the <<TAG, Tagged Branch>>.

.Release Candidate Locations (URLs):
The following uses **_WSJT-X_** as an example. Note the URL differences. At
the time of this writing, the current release candidate is **_WSJT-X v1.6 RC1_**.
Pulling the release candidate branch will get you the *Next (RC)* in
the branch, in this case *(RC3)*, not *(RC2)*.

---------

Base URL: https://svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/branches/

../wsjtx-1.6 ..: would pull WSJT-X v1.6 (RCx) next release version
../wsjtx ......: would pull WSJT-X v1.7 development branch

---------

[[TAG]]
=== Tagged Releases
A tagged version of a particular application is frozen, both in terms
of the tool set used to build it, and the feature set it provides.
Additional bug fixes or feature enhancements are sent upstream to the
development +trunk+ or +branch+. As such, the respective *(SDK)* may
or may not be able to re-build historical tagged branches correctly.
Future releases of the respective *(SDK)* may allow for this type of
regression / back-porting activity.

.Available Tag Locations (URLs):
[horizontal]
*WSJT*:: https://svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/tag/release-5.9.2
*WSPR*:: https://svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/tag/wspr212
*WSJT-X*:: https://svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/tag/wsjtx-1.6.0-rc1

IMPORTANT: In general, unless you have a specific need for an earlier
version, you should *always* use the latest tagged release version for
a given application.

Base URL: https://svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/tags/wsjtx-1.6.0-rc1
