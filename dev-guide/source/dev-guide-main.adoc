== Overview

The WSJT family of programs for weak-signal amateur radio
communication includes _WSJT_, _WSPR_, _MAP65_, _WSJT-X_, and
_WSPR-X_.  User interfaces for _WSJT_ and _WSPR_ are written in
Python3. User interfaces for _WSJT-X_, _WSPR-X_ and _MAP65_ are
written in C{plus}{plus} using the Qt5 framework. Most number-crunching
in all of the _WSJT_ programs is done in Fortran.

.This guide will walk the user through:
* Installing prerequisites packages
* Installing JTSDK (Windows and Linux) 
* Overview of packages, libraries and frameworks
* Building each application using default configurations
* Command line custom configuration builds
* Outline available tools and script capabilities
* A brief introduction to building with Qtcreator

In addition to core building tools each of the environments provides a host
of very powerful command line tools. A details list is provided in the appendix,
however, it is up to the user to reseach how best each of these tools can be
used to fully leverage the SDKs potential.
