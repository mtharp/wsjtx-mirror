== Overview

The WSJT family of programs for weak-signal amateur radio
communication includes _WSJT_, _WSPR_, _MAP65_, _WSJT-X_, and
_WSPR-X_.  User interfaces for _WSJT_ and _WSPR_ are written in
Python, and build procedures for these two programs are similar.  User
interfaces for _MAP65_, _WSJT-X_, and _WSPR-X_ are written in C++ and
use the Qt framework, and they share most build procedures.  Most
number-crunching in all of the _WSJT_ programs is done in Fortran.

Sowftware development kits are availble for Windows, and a build script 
collections for Linux. The kits are described in their respective section.
The following is a brief overview for each kit:

*JTSDK-DOC*
* Provides a self-contained collection of applicaitnos and scripts
to build all _WSJT_ Documentation.

*JTSDK-PY*
* Provides a self-contained collection of applicaitnos and scripts
to build +*Python*+ based _WSJT_ and _WSPR_.

*JTSDK-QT*
* Provides a self-contained collection of applicaitnos and scripts
to build +_*QT5*+ based _WSJT-X_, _WSPR-X_ and  _MAP65_.
