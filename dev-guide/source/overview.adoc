// Taken from WSJT Main Website
_WSJT_, _MAP65_, _WSPR_, and _WSJT-X_ are open-source programs designed for
weak-signal digital communication by amateur radio. Normal usage requires a
standard SSB transceiver and a personal computer with soundcard. SDR-style
hardware including the SDR-IQ, Perseus, SoftRock, and FUNcube Dongle is supported
by MAP65 and WSPR. SimJT is a utility program that generates simulated signals for
test purposes.

It should be noted, building _WSJT_ applications can be extremely challenging.
*JTSDK* provides a preconfigured set of packages and custom build scripts which
allow a user to build all of the main applications with minimal effort. However,
the default scripts may not be suitable for those actively developing applications
in all cases. To aid the core developers, several tools have been included that
allow for much greater flexibility in their final outputs, yet still maintain 
the core building tools for consistency. The tools and more are explained in each
of the (4) primary environments.

=== Core Features
*JTSDK* will provides the following core features:

* QT5 + mingw32 (GCC 4.8.0) winpthread Tool Chain
* MinGW32 (GCC 4.8.1) pthread Tool Chain
* MSYS Base Environment {plus} Autotools
* Cygwin 32Bit Env, Bash, Gnu Coreutils, Git, SVN {plus} much more ...
* Python2 and Python3 with Tcl/Tk in Seperate Environments
* Build Scripts for WSJT, WSJT-X, WSPR, WSPR-X and MAP65
* Build Scripts for All WSJT Documentation
* Supports Win32/64 and Linux x86/x86-64

=== Core Functions
The *JTSDK* guide will provide users with the following core functions:

* Installing prerequisites packages
* Installing JTSDK (Windows and Linux) 
* Overview of packages, libraries and frameworks
* Building each application using default configurations
* Command line custom configuration builds
* Outline available tools and script capabilities
* A brief introduction to using QtCreator for builds

In addition to the core application build tools, each environment provides a
host of very powerful command line tools. A detailed list is provided in the
appendix, however, it is up to the user to research how best to employ each tool
to fully leverage the SDKs potential.

On Windows, *JTSDK*, by design, should not interfere with any previously
installed development packages. If you find or have a conflict, please report it
to the {devmail} list.
