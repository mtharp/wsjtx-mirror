**_WSJT-X_**, **_WSJT_**, **_WSPR_**, and **_MAP65_** are open-source programs
designed for weak-signal digital communication by amateur radio. Normal usage
requires a standard SSB transceiver and a personal computer with soundcard.
SDR-style hardware including the SDR-IQ, Perseus, SoftRock, and FUNcube Dongle
is supported by MAP65 and WSPR. SimJT is a utility program that generates
simulated signals for test purposes.

It should be noted, building _WSJT_ applications can be extremely challenging.
*JTSDK* provides a preconfigured set of packages and custom build scripts which
allow a user to build all of the main applications with minimal effort. However,
the default scripts may not be suitable for those actively developing applications
in all cases. To aid the core developers, several tools have been included that
allow for much greater flexibility in their final outputs, yet still maintain 
the core building tools for consistency.

=== Core Features
While the implementation may differ slightly, both *JTSDK* for <<WINSDK,Windows>>
and <<NIXSDK,Linux>> provide similar core features.

.Hundreds of Usefull Tools
****
In both **_JTSDK-Win32_** and **_JTSDK-Nix_**, there are literaly hundreds of tools
and applications available to the user. The <<COREFEATURES,Core Features Table>>
outlines the base Frameworks, Tool-Chains, and libraries used to compile all
**_WSJT_** applications. For a detailed list, per application, see the
<<PKGMATRIX,Package Matrix>>

.Cross Platform Access
* With the exception of Windows specific applications, things line InnoSetup,
Mingw32, Cygwin, MSYS; all of the tools available for Windows can be accessed
on a Linux / OSX system and have not been listed specifically.

.Command Line Tools
* In addition to the core application build tools, each environment provides a
host of very powerful command line tools. A detailed list is provided in the
appendix, however, it is up to the user to research how best to employ each tool
to fully leverage the SDKs potential.

.Syetem Interference
* On Windows, *JTSDK-Win32*, by design, **_should not_** interfere with
any previously installed development packages. If you find or have a conflict,
please report it to the {dev_mail_list}.
