//
Generally, the package requirements are the same for Windows, Linux
and OS X. The major differences between them is the Windows compiler
requirement, Mingw32 or Mingw48_32 v.s. the standard GNU tools available
in most all Linux or OS X.

For *Windows*, it is possible, through the use of MSYS or Cygwin to 
compile the required dependencies. However, it is highly recommended
to use the Windows *JTSDKs* or pre-built binary installers from the
respective developers.

For *Linux* and *OS X*, with very few exceptions, all of the packages are
available through their respective package managers, as such, is the recommended
method of installation. Other than those distributions that use compiling
as their primary install method (Arch, Gentoo, Slackware, and Friends), 
compiling dependencies is unnecessary in most cases. If you need to
compile a dependency from source, consult the respective website or
details from within the package. Most are fairly straight forward.

=== Linux

The following matrix outlines the *Linux* development package
requirements for each application, including documentation.

Package names very between Linux distributions. Distro package names, 
when known, are listed in the build section of each application. If
you have a firm list of packages for your Linux distribution,
send it to {devmail} for inclusion in {page}.

WARNING: KVASD requires 32-Bit libc6. Some Linux distros
call these multi-libs, others ia32-libs, some are individual libraries.
If your using a 64-Bit OS the following 32-Bit libraries must be
installed in addition too the package matrix requirements:
