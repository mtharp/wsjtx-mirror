=== Linux

The following matrix outlines the *Linux* development package
requirements for each application, including documentation.

Package names very between Linux distributions. Distro package names, 
when known, are listed in the build section of each application. If
you have a firm list of packages for your Linux distribution,
send it to {devmail} for inclusion in the guide.

WARNING: KVASD requires 32-Bit libc6. Some Linux distros
call these multi-libs, others ia32-libs, some are individual libraries.
If your using a 64-Bit OS the following 32-Bit libraries must be
installed in addition too the package matrix requirements:
