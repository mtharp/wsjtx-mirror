Generally, the package requirements are the same for Windows, Linux
and OS X. The major differences between them is the Windows compiler
requirement, Mingw32 or pass:[Mingw48_32] v.s. the distributions version
of GNU Tool Chain.

For *Windows*, it is possible, through the use of MSYS or Cygwin to 
compile the required dependencies. However, it is highly recommended
to use the Windows *JTSDKs* or pre-built binary installers from the
respective developers.

For *Linux* and *OS X*, with very few exceptions, all of the packages are
available through their respective package managers, as such, is the recommended
method of installation. Other than those distributions that use compiling
as their primary install method (Arch, Gentoo, Slackware, and Friends), 
compiling dependencies is unnecessary in most cases. If you need to
compile a dependency from source, consult the respective website or
details from within the package. Most are fairly straight forward.

=== Windows

The following matrix outlines the *Windows* development package
requirements for each application, including documentation. The
( {y} ) indicates a required package, ( {o} ) is optional, blank is
not applicable.

==== Version Matrix
The following package versions are used in *JTSDK-Win32*. While later versions
may work, the table represents what is currently deployed.

IMPORTANT: Package versions used in JTSDK v2 may or may not be the latest available
from the links provided below. Using the latest and greatest *does not*, in any
way, gaurentee a sucessful build environment. If you use a different version,
understand the risks before hand.

==== Python3 Modules
**_WSJT_** and **_WSPR_** are failry sensitive to Python Module versions. This
is due primarly to the way each module is imported at runtime. Python3 NumPy has
a sensitivity the tool chain used to compile the module. It is for this reason,
on *Windows*, Python3 NumPy was built using the same tool chain both
**_WSJT_** and **_WSPR_** are compiled with ( _Mingw32_ ). All other modules
were installed using a simple windows installer or provided by a module
itself, *F2py* for example, is provided by *NumPy*.
