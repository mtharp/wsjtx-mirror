*  Messages in FSK441 and JT6M have no fixed structure.  They are sent
   character-by-character, with typical lengths 2 to 20 characters.  TxT
   values are given for the message "WA1ABC 26 KC0XYZ 2626 ".


The following paragraphs provide additional details, including a 
summary of design goals and methods of achieving them.

Group 1. Meteor Scatter
-----------------------

FSK441 was designed for meteor scatter, especially on 2m.  User
messages are sent character-by-character, with no error-correcting
code.  Modulation is 4-FSK, keyed at 441 baud.  With adequate S/N
(minimum ping strength (S+N)/N around 2 dB) the protocol is self
synchronizing.  Character transmission rate is 147 cps, so copying the
message "WA1ABC 26 KC0XYZ 2626 " requires a ping duration of at least
150 ms.

JTMS has the same basic design goals as FSK441.  User messages are
"source encoded" into packets of n=30, 48, or 78 bits, using lossless
compression.  Forward error correction (FEC) is added using a K=13,
r=1/2 convolutional code.  A 32-bit synchronizing vector is appended.
The number of transmitted symbols in a message is thus 2*(n+K-1)+32.
Modulation is MSK ("minimum shift keying") at 1500 baud.  The raw data
rate is 1500 bps and the bandwidth 2250 Hz.  The 78-bit user message
requires 212 channel symbols and is transmitted in 141 ms.  The 48-bit
and 30-bit messages require 101 ms and 77 ms, respectively.  The
32-bit sync vector makes it easy for the decoder to recognize
start-of-message, and the strong FEC means that messages are usually
copied exactly, or not at all.  Sensitivity is about the same as
FSK441, but short pings can be used more effectively and "garbage
decodes" are much fewer.


Group 2. Ionospheric Scatter on 6 m
-----------------------------------

JT6M was designed to take advantage of the mixture of ionospheric
scatter and meteor scatter typically seen at distances 800-2000 km on
50 MHz.  As in FSK441, user messages are sent character-by-character,
with no error-correcting code.  Modulation is continuous-phase 44-FSK
at 21.5 baud.  Each tone represents a distinct character from an
alphabet of 43 characters, or else a synchronizing tone; the sync tone
is sent in every 3rd symbol interval. The character transmission rate
is 14.4 cps, and no start-of-message synchronization is provided.
Messages can be decoded at S/N down to -10 dB.

ISCAT has similar design goals to JT6M, but achieves them more
effectively.  As in JTMS, messages are source-encoded to 30, 48, or 78
bits.  FEC redundancy is added using one of the Reed Solomon codes
RS(63,5), RS(63,8), or RS(63,13), with 6-bit symbols.  Synchronizing
information is appended as a sequence of 12 symbols: a 10x10 Costas
array, followed by two symbols that distinguish between the three
possible message lengths.  Modulation is 64-FSK keyed at 23.4 baud, so
the total bandwidth is 64*23.4 = 1500 Hz.  Messages are repeated about
9.3 times in a 30 s transmission.  ISCAT signals are decodable at
average S/N down to about -15 dB.  Decoding is much more reliable than
with JT6M, and false-decode garbage is much less.


Group 3. EME on VHF and UHF bands, QRP at HF
--------------------------------------------

JT65 was designed for EME on the VHF bands.  It has also proven
effective for EME on the UHF bands, and it has become very popular for
QRP use at HF.  Messages are source-encoded to 72 bits and carry
Reed-Solomon error control using a (63,12) code and 6-bit symbols.
Synchronizing information is sent as a pseudo-random pattern of 126
ON/OFF intervals of a single tone.  Encoded data is sent using 64-MSK
modulation during the 63 sync-OFF intervals.  The keying rate is
2.69 baud, so a full transmission takes 126/2.69 = 46.8 s.  Total
bandwidth is 178 Hz (JT65A), 355 Hz (JT65B), or 711 Hz (JT65C).
Decoding is done using the Koetter-Vardy algebraic soft-decision
algorithm.  Arbitrary JT65B messages can be reliably copied down to
S/N = -24 dB.  The "Deep Search" decoder can copy messages involving
callsigns found in a local database down to -28 dB.  Shorthand codes
are available to convey the simple messages "RO", "RRR", and "73", and
these can be copied down to -30 dB and below.

JT64 builds on the best features of JT65 and adds further
enhancements.  In place of 72-bit messages it offers 30, 48, and
78-bit messages, as well as shorthands like those in JT65.  The new
message structure allows arbitrary add-on prefixes rather than
prefixes selected from a restricted list.  Plain text messages can be
up to 14 characters (cf. 13 characters in JT65).  Synchronization is
achieved by means of three 6x6 Costas-array patterns, instead of a
single sync tone.  Only 28% of transmitted energy is devoted to
synchronization, compared with 50% in JT65 -- yet sync and AFC
performance are both better than in JT65.  The 78-bit messages can be
copied down to about -26 dB, and 30-bit messages down to -29 dB.

An alternative (perhaps optional?) configuration for JT64 would use
T/R sequences of 30 s rather than 60 s.  In EME contest situations
this could permit QSO rates up to about 20 per hour.  In this case the
parameters would change to nsps=3240, baud=3.704, and BW=237 Hz.
Sensitivity would be 3 dB worse than the figures given above -- nearly
as good as JT65B with one-minute sequences.

JT8 is proposed as an alternative to JT65A for QRP use at HF, or
wherever a very narrow bandwidth is needed.  It uses the same message
structures as the other new modes, with source-encoding of user
information into 30-, 48-, or 78-bit frames.  FEC is applied using
strong convolutional codes (K=14, r=1/4; K=15, r=1/6; or K=16, r=1/8,
depending on message length.  Modulation is 8_FSK at 2.857 baud.
Synchronization is achieved by transmitting an 8x8 Costas array at
both beginning and end of a transmission, with two additional symbols
that distinguish between 30-bit, 48-bit, and 78-bit message content.
