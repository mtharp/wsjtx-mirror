Meteor Scatter
--------------

FSK441 was designed for meteor scatter, especially on 2m.  User
messages are sent character by character, with no error-correcting
code.  Modulation is 4-FSK, keyed at 441 baud.  With adequate S/N
(minimum ping strength (S+N)/N around 2 dB) the protocol is self
synchronizing.  Character transmission rate is 147 cps, so copying the
message "WA1ABC 26 KC0XYZ 2626 " requires a ping duration of at least
150 ms.

JTMS has the same basic design goals as FSK441.  User messages are
"source encoded" into packets of n=30, 48, or 78 bits, using lossless
compression.  Forward error correction (FEC) is added using a K=13,
r=1/2 convolutional code.  A 32-bit synchronizing vector is appended.
The number of transmitted symbols in a message is thus 2*(n+K-1)+32.
Modulation is MSK ("minimum shift keying") at 1500 baud.  The raw data
rate is 1500 bps and the bandwidth 2250 Hz.  The 78-bit user message
requires 212 channel symbols and is transmitted in 141 ms.  The 48-bit
and 30-bit messages require 101 ms and 77 ms, respectively.  The
32-bit sync vector makes it easy for the decoder to recognize
start-of-message, and the strong FEC means that messages are usually
copied exactly (or not at all).  Sensitivity is about the same as
FSK441, but shorter pings can be used more effectively and "garbage
decodes" are much fewer.


Ionospheric Scatter on 6m
-------------------------

JT6M was designed to take advantage of the mixture of ionospheric
scatter and meteor scatter that is typically seen at distances
800-2000 km on 50 MHz.  As in FSK441, user messages are sent character
by character, with no further encoding.  Modulation is
continuous-phase 44-FSK at 21.5 baud.  Each tone represents a distinct
character from an "alphabet" of 43 characters, or else a synchronizing
tone; the sync tone is sent in every 3rd symbol interval. The
character transmission rate is 14.4 cps, and no start-of-message
synchronizing is provided.  Messages can be decoded at signal levels
as low as S/N = -10 dB in a 2500 Hz reference noise bandwidth.

ISCAT has similar design goals to JT6M, but achieves them much more
effectively.  As in JTMS, messages are source-encoded to 30, 48, or 78
bits.  FEC redundancy is added using one of the Reed Solomon codes
(63,5), (63,8), or (63,13), with 6-bit symbols.  Synchronizing
information is appended as a sequence of eight tones forming an 8x8
"Costas array".  Different Costas arrays are used to denote 30-bit,
48-bit, and 78-bit messages.  Modulation is 64-FSK and keyed at 23.4
baud, so the total bandwidth is 64*23.4 = 1500 Hz.  Messages are
repeated 9 times in a 27.3 s transmission.  Under conditions of
additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading, ISCAT
signals are decodable on brief signal enhancements at S/N = -10 dB,
and with weaker signals that may average as little as -18 dB.
Decoding is much more reliable than with JT6M, and on-screen decoding
garbage is much less.


EME on VHF and UHF bands
------------------------

JT65 was designed for EME on the VHF bands, and has proven effective
on UHF bands as well.  Messages are source-encoded to 72 bits and
carry Reed-Solomon error control using a (63,12) code and 6-bit
symbols.  Synchronizing information is sent as a pseudo-random pattern
of 126 ON/OFF intervals of a single tone.  Encoded data is sent using
64-MSK modulation during the 63 "sync OFF" intervals.  The keying rate
is 2.69 baud, so a full transmission takes 126/2.69 = 46.8 s.  Total
bandwidth is 178 Hz (JT65A), 355 Hz (JT65B), or 711 Hz (JT65C).
Decoding is done using the Koetter-Vardy algebraic soft-decision
algorithm.  Arbitrary JT65B messages can be reliably copied down to
S/N = -24 dB.  The "Deep Search" decoder can copy messages involving
callsigns found in a local database down to -28 dB.  Shorthand codes
are available to convey the simple messages "RO", "RRR", and "73", and
these can be copied down to -30 dB or below.

JT64 builds on the best features of JT65 and adds further enhancements
and better performance.  In place of 72-bit messages it offers 30, 48,
and 78-bit messages, as well as shorthands like those of JT655.  Only
28% of transmitted energy is devoted to message synchronization,
compared with 50% in JT65 -- yet sync performance is at least as good as
JT65.  Arbitrary add-on prefixes are allowed, rather than prefixes
selected from a restricted list.  The 78-bit messages can be copied down
to about -26 dB, and 30-bit messages down to -29 dB.
