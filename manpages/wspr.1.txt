== NAME

wspr - Weak Signal Propagation Reporter


== SYNOPSIS

*wspr* - "Pronounced Whisper", does not take command-line options. To run from the
command-line:
-----
After Install
Open terminal, cd ~/.wspr, then type ..: wspr

After Install & Called Using Python
Open terminal, cd ~/.wspr, then type ..: python3 -O wspr.py
-----
For more information see <<X1,*documentation*>>. 


== PROGRAMS

There are (6) programs associated with *WSPR*:

*WSPR* - Stands for "Weak Signal Propagation Reporter". The WSPR software is
designed for probing potential radio propagation paths using low-power beacon-like transmissions. *WSPR* does not take command-line augments, simply run the
application and setup your stations parameters.

*WSPR0* - is a simple command-line version of WSPR with no frills,
no graphics and no GUI.  Many advanced features of the full WSPR
program, including I/Q mode, frequency hopping, and automatic
uploading of spots to WSPRnet.org, are not included.  *wspr0* is 
intended for specialized uses where its easy compilation, small memory
requirements, etc., can be advantageous.

*FMTEST* - Sets the dial frequency of a CAT-controlled radio and performs
a sequence of measurements for the strongest resulting audio tone near a 
specified offset frequency. Input parameters are taken from the command line,
and output goes to files fmt.out and fmt.all. The latter file is cumulative.

*FMTAVE* - Averages data found in a specified file having the format of fmt.all

*FCAL* - Calculates a best-fit straight line for a data saved in fmtave.out.
Results are saved in file fcal.out.

*FMEASURE* - Calculates the properly calibrated frequency of each test signal
found in file fmtave.out. Results are saved in file fmeasure.out, and these
are the numbers you should report if you are entering the Frequency Measuring
Test.
