.SH "NAME"
wspr \- Weak Signal Propagation Reporter
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBwspr\fR \- "Pronounced Whisper", does not take command\-line options\&. To run from the command\-line:
.sp
.nf
After Install, to run WSPR:

Applications Menu
Applications > HamRadio > WSPR

From Unity Dash
Dash > WSPR > Click on the Globe

Command Line
Open terminal, type\&.\&.: wspr

.SH "PROGRAMS"
.sp
There are (7) programs associated with \fBWSPR\fR
.sp
\fBWSPR\fR \- The program generates and decodes a digital soundcard mode optimized for beacon\-like transmissions on the LF, MF, and HF bands
.sp
\fBWSPR0\fR \- is a simple command\-line version of WSPR with no frills, no graphics and no GUI\&. Many advanced features of the full WSPR program, including I/Q mode, frequency hopping, and automatic uploading of spots to WSPRnet\&.org, are not included\&. \fBwspr0\fR is intended for specialized uses where its easy compilation, small memory requirements, etc\&., can be advantageous\&.
.sp
\fBFMTEST\fR \- Sets the dial frequency of a CAT\-controlled radio and performs a sequence of measurements for the strongest resulting audio tone near a specified offset frequency\&. Input parameters are taken from the command line, and output goes to files fmt\&.out and fmt\&.all\&. The latter file is cumulative\&.
.sp
\fBFMTAVE\fR \- Averages data found in a specified file having the format of fmt\&.all
.sp
\fBFCAL\fR \- Calculates a best\-fit straight line for a data saved in fmtave\&.out\&. Results are saved in file fcal\&.out\&.
.sp
\fBFMEASURE\fR \- Calculates the properly calibrated frequency of each test signal found in file fmtave\&.out\&. Results are saved in file fmeasure\&.out, and these are the numbers you should report if you are entering the Frequency Measuring Test\&.
.sp
\fBWSPRCODE\fR \- This program provides examples of the source encoding, convolutional error\-control coding, bit and symbol ordering, and synchronizing information contained in WSPR messages\&.
.SH "BUGS"
.sp
If you find a bug or suspect \fB\fIwspr\fR\fR is not acting as you think it should, send an email with as much detail as possible to: <wsjt\-devel@lists\&.sourceforge\&.net>
