.SH "NAME"
wspr \- Weak Signal Propagation Reporter
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBwspr\fR \- "Pronounced Whisper", does not take command\-line options\&. To run from the command\-line:
.sp
.nf
After Install
Open terminal, cd ~/\&.wspr, then type \&.\&.: wspr

After Install & Called Using Python
Open terminal, cd ~/\&.wspr, then type \&.\&.: python3 \-O wspr\&.py
.fi

.SH "PROGRAMS"
.sp
There are (6) programs associated with \fBWSPR\fR:
.sp
\fBWSPR\fR \- Stands for "Weak Signal Propagation Reporter"\&. The WSPR software is designed for probing potential radio propagation paths using low\-power beacon\-like transmissions\&. \fBWSPR\fR does not take command\-line augments, simply run the application and setup your stations parameters\&.
.sp
\fBWSPR0\fR \- is a simple command\-line version of WSPR with no frills, no graphics and no GUI\&. Many advanced features of the full WSPR program, including I/Q mode, frequency hopping, and automatic uploading of spots to WSPRnet\&.org, are not included\&. \fBwspr0\fR is intended for specialized uses where its easy compilation, small memory requirements, etc\&., can be advantageous\&.
.sp
\fBFMTEST\fR \- Sets the dial frequency of a CAT\-controlled radio and performs a sequence of measurements for the strongest resulting audio tone near a specified offset frequency\&. Input parameters are taken from the command line, and output goes to files fmt\&.out and fmt\&.all\&. The latter file is cumulative\&.
.sp
\fBFMTAVE\fR \- Averages data found in a specified file having the format of fmt\&.all
.sp
\fBFCAL\fR \- Calculates a best\-fit straight line for a data saved in fmtave\&.out\&. Results are saved in file fcal\&.out\&.
.sp
\fBFMEASURE\fR \- Calculates the properly calibrated frequency of each test signal found in file fmtave\&.out\&. Results are saved in file fmeasure\&.out, and these are the numbers you should report if you are entering the Frequency Measuring Test\&.
.SH "BUGS"

If you find a bug or suspect \fB\fIwspr\fR\fR is not acting as you think it should, send an email with as much detail as possible to: <wsjt\-devel@lists\&.sourceforge\&.net>
