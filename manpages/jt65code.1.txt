== NAME

jt65code, jt4code - Weak signal communications encoding support utility.

== SYNOPSIS

*jt65code* "'MESSAGE'"

*jt65code* ['OPTIONS']

*jt4code* "'MESSAGE'"

*jt4code* ['OPTIONS']

== OPTIONS

TO-DO - Add options


== DESCRIPTION

*jt65code*, and *jt4code* are utility programs that let you
explore the conversion of user-level messages into channel symbols or
“tone numbers.”  These programs can be useful to someone designing a
beacon generator for JT65 or JT4, or for studying behavior of the
error-control codes for each of the protocols.

For the corresponding program jt65code only the information-carrying
channel symbols are shown, and the symbol values range from 0 to
63. Sync synbols lie two tone intervals below data tone 0, and the
sequential locations of sync symbols are described in the JT65
Protocol section of this Guide.

A typical execution of jt65code is shown below. The program displays
the packed message of 72 bits, shown here as 12 six-bit symbol values,
followed by the channel symbols:

.....
$ jt65code "G0XYZ K1ABC FN42"
Message:   G0XYZ K1ABC FN42
Packed message, 6-bit symbols:  61 36 45 30  3 55  3  2 14  5 33 40
Information-carrying channel symbols:
   56 40  8 40 51 47 50 34 44 53 22 53 28 31 13 60 46  2 14 58 43
   41 58 35  8 35  3 24  1 21 41 43  0 25 54  9 41 54  7 25 21  9
   62 59  7 43 31 21 57 13 59 41 17 49 19 54 21 39 33 42 18  2 60
Decoded message: G0XYZ K1ABC FN42
.....

For an illustration of the power of the strong error-control coding in
JT65 and JT4, try looking at the channel symbols after changing a
single character in the message.  For example, change the grid locater
from FN42 to FN43 in the JT65 message:

.....
$ jt65code "G0XYZ K1ABC FN43"
Message:   G0XYZ K1ABC FN43
Packed message, 6-bit symbols:  61 36 45 30  3 55  3  2 14  5 33 41
Information-carrying channel symbols:
   25 35 47  8 13  9 61 40 44  9 51  6  8 40 38 34  8  2 21 23 30
   51 32 56 39 35  3 50 48 30  8  5 40 18 54  9 24 30 26 61 23 11
    3 59  7  7 39  1 25 24  4 50 17 49 52 19 34  7  4 34 61  2 61
Decoded message: G0XYZ K1ABC FN43
.....

You will discover that every possible JT65 message differs from every
other possible JT65 message in at least 52 of the 63
information-carrying channel symbols.
