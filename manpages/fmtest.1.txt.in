== NAME

fmtest - Frequency Measurement Testing


== SYNOPSIS

*fmtest* [kHz] [0|1] [offset] [range] [tsec] [call]

Sets the dial frequency of a CAT-controlled radio and performs
a sequence of measurements of the strongest resulting audio tone near a
specified offset frequency. Input parameters are taken from the command
line, or specified in gocal script, and the output goes to files fmt.out.
All 6 parameters are required. See *Resources* for full documentaton and examples.


== DESCRIPTION

*khz*::
Dial frequency in Kilohertz

*0|1*::
*0* for measuring unknown frequencies, *1* for known frequency. For rig
calibration *1* should be used, as *0* is for the use with the *ARRL FMT*
tests.

*offset*::
Frequency offset to measure, in khz

*range*::
Range of frequency measurement, in khz

*tsec*::
Length of time to measure, in seconds

*call*::
Station callsign, WWV for example
