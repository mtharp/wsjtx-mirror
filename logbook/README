WSJT Logbook
------------

Status: In Development

This is a "work in progress" to enable the use of an Sqlite3 Database,
which is bundeled with virtually all current Python2/3 distributions.
The main features will include, but may not be limited to:

* Call3 Text Data Management
* WSJT Specific QSO Looging
* ADIF Exports
* Basic Report Generation and Queries
* Explore the possibility of contest logging.
 
The data present in the *call3* table was generated from the CALL3.txt file
located in ^/trunk/CALL3.TXT

A CSV ( call3.csv ) file generated from CALL3.TXT has also been provided to
facilitate script automation testing. Several fields from the CALL3.TXT
file were re-structured to correct CSV import errors.

All database files (wsjt.db, wsjt.sql, call3.csv ) are in an unstable state
and may not represent the final configuration when / if the SQLite3 integration
moves forward to a release state.

Browsing the database can easily be done through the use of many Open Source
SQLite3 Database Management tools. With these tools you can perform virtuall
any SQLite3 function, including data manipulation, including creating your own
CALL3.TXT file for use with WSJT as it stands now.

* GUI Based Tools

* Browser Based Tools
-- Firefox Plugin: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/

Other browsers have plugins; search for them as you would for other browser
based tools.
