Hamlib TS-2000 - k1jt - WSJT-X "Mode" != "None" glitches when Tx QRG changes

       Trying to read "other" VFO mode requires FRn command to "other"
       VFO which is source of glitch when split.

       Current best workaround is to  set "Mode" to "None" in Settings
       which stops WSJT-X trying to manipulate rig mode.

Hamlib FT-847 - Eddy G6UQI - fails to start
Hamlib FT-847 - Mark w7mem - fails to start

       Sent version with CAT trace - waiting log file.

       HamlibTranceiver::init_rig() not coping with  no get VFO and no
       toggle VFO CAT command available, changed to just assume A/MAIN
       is always the Rx VFO on such rigs.

Commander TS-2000 - Jim wb6dkh - SPLIT disappearing
Commander TS-2000 - David wd4kpd - possibly the same issue

	  VOX keying might be the factor.
	  Sent logs to Dave aa6yq for comment.

	  Further investigation now points to the auto-atu which swaps
	  VFO and mode while tuning, this may be confusing Commander.

	  Dave  aa6yq  confirms  that WinWarbler  will  interact  with
	  Commander  and cause  this issue  when the  TS-2000 auto-ATU
	  switches to CW during the tuning sequence. Passed info on to
	  wb6dkh & wd4kpd.

	  Not fixed for wd4kpd as he  doesn't use WW. Sent tracing RC2
	  - awaiting log and match Commander ErrorLog.txt.

Commander TS-2000 - Jim wb6dkh - Fake split

	  Leaving wrong QRG (Tx) current.
	  Need trace for this issue.

Flex 6000 (TS-2000 emulation) - George kf2t - fails to read QRG
Flex 6700 - Ed k0kc - No CAT no PTT

     Flex doesn't have FB; command.

     Sent kf2t test version that doesn't query TX QRG if not in split.

     Sent RC3 preview with a hotfix (r4434) to kf2t & k0kc.

     Caveats with  PowerSDR & FlexRadio  SDRs:-

     * Data mode cannot be set from WSJT-X, USB should be OK otherwise
       use "None" and set mode manually.

     * Split operation  is not possible,  this should not be  an issue
       given that wide band Tx is available on these radios.

     Initial reports from kf2t indicate a successful fix.

Windows (Finestra WM) - Josh kk1d - Application not staying inside virtual desktop

Hamlib TS-570D - Peter Pauly ????? - Protocol error while getting TX frequency

       Split not required so r4434 may have resolved this anyway.

       Sent trace version of RC2 - awaiting log.

Hamlib FT-450 - Rudy ve3bdr - Protocol error while getting mode of split VFO

       May be  fixed by  r4434. I  have asked Rudy  to try  again with
       "Mode" set to "None".

       Not fixed. Sent trace version of RC2, awaiting log.
