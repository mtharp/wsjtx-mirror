Hamlib TS-2000 - k1jt - WSJT-X "Mode" != "None" glitches when Tx QRG changes

       Trying to read "other" VFO mode requires FRn command to "other"
       VFO which is source of glitch when split.

       Current best workaround is to  set "Mode" to "None" in Settings
       which stops WSJT-X trying to manipulate rig mode.

Hamlib FT-847 - Eddy G6UQI - fails to start

       Sent version with CAT trace - waiting log file.

Commander TS-2000 - Jim wb6dkh - SPLIT disappearing
Commander TS-2000 - David wd4kpd - possibly the same issue

	  VOX keying might be the factor.
	  Sent logs to Dave aa6yq for comment.

	  Further investigation now points to the auto-atu which swaps
	  VFO and mode while tuning, this may be confusing Commander.

Commander TS-2000 - Jim wb6dkh - Fake split

	  Leaving wrong QRG (Tx) current.
	  Need trace for this issue.

Flex 6000 (TS-2000 emulation) - George kf2t - fails to read QRG
Flex 6700 - Ed k0kc - No CAT no PTT

     Flex doesn't have FB; command.

     Sent kf2t test version that doesn't query TX QRG if not in split.

     Sent RC3 preview with a hotfix (r4434) to kf2t & k0kc.

     Caveats with  PowerSDR & FlexRadio  SDRs:-

     * Data mode cannot be set from WSJT-X, USB should be OK otherwise
       use "None" and set mode manually.

     * Split operation  is not possible,  this should not be  an issue
       given that wide band Tx is available on these radios.

Windows (Finestra WM) - Josh kk1d - Application not staying inside virtual desktop
