For quick reference, here's a short list of features and capabilities
added to _WSJT-X_ since Version 1.5.0:

- *WSPR* mode, including automatic coordinated band-hopping and an
improved sensitivity two-pass decoder.

- EME-inspired features including *JT4* (submodes *A-G*), *Echo* mode,
and *automatic Doppler tracking*.  Note that submodes *JT65B* and
*JT65C* are also present in Version 1.6, but the high-sensitivity
decoder required for EME is not yet included.

- Tools for accurate *frequency calibration* of your radio, so you can
be automatically ``on frequency'' to within about 1 Hz.

- Mode-specific working frequencies accessible from the drop-down
band selector.
