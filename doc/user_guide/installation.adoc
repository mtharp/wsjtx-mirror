[[INSTALL_WIN]]
=== Windows

- Download _WSJT_ from the {homepage}. Click on _WSJT_ at the left
margin and then on the desired download link.

- Execute the downloaded file and follow its installation 
instructions.

- Install _WSJT_ into its own directory rather than the conventional
location +C:\Program Files\WSJT10+.  The suggested default directory is
+C:\WSJT10+.

- All files relating to _WSJT_ will be stored in the chosen
installation directory and its subdirectories. You can uninstall
_WSJT_ by removing the installation directory and its contents.

- The built-in Windows facility for time synchronization is usually
not adequate.  We recommend Meinberg NTP: see {ntpsetup} for
downloading and installation instructions.  

CAUTION: If you are using a sound card that is also the Windows
default audio device, be sure to turn off all Windows sounds so they
are not transmitted over the air.


[[INSTALL_UBU]]
=== Linux

Still to come ...

[[INSTALL_OSX]]
=== OS X

This guide refers to installation of _WSJT_ on Mac OSX 10.7 and 10.9.  This scheme should also work on OSX 10.8 but has not been tested.  There are
problems with Tcl/Tk libraries which prevent the code from running on OSX 10.10.
You will need to be familiar with Unix commands in a Terminal window.

- Install the latest version of Xcode, available free from developer.apple.com.
Launch Xcode and visit Preferences -> Downloads and select "command line tools" 
and install them.

- You will need a Fortran compiler.  Visit  https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries#MacOS
and select an installer for your OSX version.

- The default Python installed on a Mac is version 2.7.   A later version is required.  Visit
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-342/ and select _Mac OS X 64-bit/32-bit installer_.  Download the package 
and install.

- For the next downloads I recommend that you create an installation directory and use this
for the downloads that follow.  

- You need the _numpy_ suite.   Visit http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.9.1/ and download _numpy-1.9.1.tar.gz_.   
Expand this file and type: +
 :: python setup.py build --fcompiler=gnu95 +
 :: sudo python setup.py install +

- Install portaudio.  Visit  http://www.portaudio.com/download.html and download _pa_snapshot.tgz_.  Expand this file
and type: +
 :: configure +
 :: make +
 :: sudo make install +

- Install libsamplerate.  Visit  http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/download.html and download _libsamplerate-0.1.8.tar.gz_.  Expand this file and type: +
 :: configure +
 :: make +
 :: sudo make install +

- Install Fast Fourier code.  Visit http://www.fftw.org/download.html and download _fftw_3.3.4.tar.gz_ and expand the file. Type: +
 :: configure --enable-float +
 :: make +
 :: sudo make install +

- Install PIL for imaging.  Type: +
 ::  sudo pip install Pillow +

- Now it is time to download the source code.  Type the following which will download the complete source tree
and install in a new directory _wsjt_.   
 :: svn co svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/trunk wsjt +

- Finally, change your working directory to _wsjt_ and type: +
 :: configure --with-portaudio-include-dir=/usr/local/include --with-portaudio-lib-dir=/usr/local/lib +
 :: make +
 :: python wsjt.py +

and if all has proceeded without error, _WSJT_ should launch.

You will need a Mac driver to control the serial link between your Mac and the transmitter.

[[SRC_CODE]]
=== Source Code

Source code is available from the public repository at {devsvn}. To
compile the program you will need to install the following packages:

- Subversion
- Python 3.x, and the following Python packages
** python3-numpy
** python3-imaging-tk
** python3-pil
** python3-pil.imagetk
- gcc
- gfortran
- fftw3
- PortAudio
- libsamplerate
- MinGW (for Windows only)

With Subversion installed, the full source code for _WSJT_ can be
downloaded with the command:

  svn co http://svn.code.sf.net/p/wsjt/wsjt/trunk

// Need further compiling Instructions
For some basic instructions on building _WSJT_ from source code, see the
section <<COMPILING,Compiling WSJT-X>> near the end of this Guide.
