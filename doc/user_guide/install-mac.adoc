// These instructions are up-to-date for WSJT-X v{VERSION}

* OS X 10.7 and later: {osx} 

* After downloading it to your desktop, double-click on the dmg file
and consult its +ReadMe+ file for important installation notes.

* If you have already installed a previous version, you can retain it by
changing its name in the *Applications* folder (say, from _WSJT-X_ to
_WSJT-X_previous_).  You can then proceed to the installation phase.

* Remember to use the Mac's *Audio MIDI Setup* utility to configure
your sound card for 48000 Hz, two-channel, 16-bit format.

* Use *System Preferences* to select an external time source to keep
your system clock synchronized to UTC.

* To uninstall simply drag the _WSJT-X_ application from *Applications* 
to the *Trash Can*.
