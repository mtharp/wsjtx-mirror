=== Top Row

The following buttons appear just under the decoded text windows on
the main screen.  Note that some controls appear only in certain
operating modes.

image::images/MainButtons.png[align="left",width=650]

[horizontal] 
*Log QSO*:: Click to add an entry for the callsign in To radio* to the
*log file +WSJT.LOG+.  Logged information includes date, time,
*callsign, locator, band, mode and reported signal strength.  This 
button is also used to indicate a completed auto sequence QSO by 
blinking red, this can be cleared by logging the contact, pressing
Alt-N or right mouse clicking the button.

*Stop*:: Click to terminate *Monitor* mode.

*Monitor*:: Start a series of reception intervals, perhaps to monitor
a calling frequency or to copy another station engaged in a QSO.  The
button is highlighted in [green]*GREEN* when *Monitor* is active.

*Decode*:: Analyze the most recently recorded or opened file, perhaps
after one or more decoding parameters have been changed.

*Erase*:: Clear all information in the main text boxes and graphical
areas.

*Clear Avg*:: Erase text in average message box, and clear the message
accumulator.

*Include*:: If signal level is greater than -33 dB, add most recent
symbol sprectrum to the average message accumulator, even if *Sync* is
less than stated threshold.

*Exclude*:: Remove the most recent spectrum from the average message
accumulator.  Use this option when you are sure that the program has
synchronized incorrectly (for example, because *DF* and/or *DT* differ
substantially from expected values) and you wish to avoid
contaminating the average with bad data.

*Tx Stop*:: Terminate a transmission and set *Auto Off*.

=== Left
Controls related to the DX station and date and time are found at
lower left of the main window:

image::images/Main_Left.png[align="center",alt=""]

*To radio*:: The callsign of a station you wish to contact.

*Grid*:: The Maidenhead locator of the DX station, either four or six
characters.

*Lookup*:: Search database +CALL3.TXT+ for the entry in *To radio*. If
callsign is found, retrieve the station's *Grid* locator and use it to
calculate distance, azimuth, and Doppler shift.

*Add*:: Add the displayed callsign and grid locator to the database file
+CALL3.TXT+.  If an entry for this callsign already exists, you will be
asked if you want to replace it.

*Dsec*:: Adjust UTC clock reading in 0.5 s increments to manually
synchronize with UTC or with your QSO partner's computer.  (In
general, it is best to keep the computder clock set accurately and
*Dsec* set to zero.)

=== Center

Near the center of the main window are controls frequencly used 
during a QSO.  Some controls are available only in certain modes; 
the following images apply to modes JTMS (left) and JT4 (right):

image::images/Main_Center.png[align="center",alt=""]

[horizontal]

*S*, *Sync*:: Set minimum signal level for detection or synchronizing
threshold.

*Zap*:: Filter out birdies (narrowband signals of approximately constant
amplitude) before attempting to decode.

*Tol*:: Set decoder's tolerance (in Hz) to frequency offsets.  

*AFC*:: Enable automatic frequency control to compensate for a
drifting signal.

*Rx ST*:: Enable decoding of shorthand (single-tone) messages.

*Freeze*:: Search only frequencies *Freeze DF* Â± *Tol* Hz.  Adjust
*Freeze DF* by using the *F11* and *F12* keys.  In JT65 and JT4 mode,
*Freeze DF* can also be set by clicking on the red spike or on the SpecJT
waterfall display.

*MinW*:: Set the minimum Doppler spread or tone width assumed for the
JT4 decoding process.  (Letter D corresponds to the tone spacing of
the JT4D submode, etc.)

*Tx First*:: Check this box to transmit during the first period of the
timed T/R cycle.  Uncheck it if your QSO partner is transmitting in
the first period. ``First'' is defined as the first T/R interval of a
UTC hour, and alternately thereafter.

*Tx ST*:: Enable transmission of single-tone messages.

*TX Auto*:: Along with Auto is On enable auto TX sequencing in ISCAT mode.

*Rpt*:: Signal report to be inserted in generated messages.

*Gen Msgs*:: Generate standard Tx messages for the active mode.

*Auto*:: Toggle *On* or *Off* to start or stop automatic sequences of
transmit and receive periods.

=== Right

Controls for tranmitted messages appear at the right of the main
window.  You can insert a desired message into any of the six entry
fields.  The *Gen Msgs* button does this auromatically, in the
appropriate format for the mode in use.  The message marked in one of
the circles will be the one sent at the start of the next Tx sequence.
You can start a message immediately by clicking one of the *Tx1*
through *Tx6* buttons.
