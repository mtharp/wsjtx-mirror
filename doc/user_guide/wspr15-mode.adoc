_WSPR-15_ is an experimental mode intended for use with extremely weak signals
on the MF and LF bands.  In effect, everything is slowed down by a factor of 8
relative to the normal _WSPR_ mode (which is now also called _WSPR-2_, when 
confusion might otherwise arise). Keying rate and tone separation in _WSPR-15_ 
are 0.183 baud and 0.183 Hz, respectively; the total bandwidth is 0.732 Hz, and
the weakest decodable signals have S/N around –37 dB in a 2500 Hz reference 
bandwidth. _WSPR-15_ does not presently support I/Q mode or band hopping.

When used with standard SSB transceivers, _WSPR-2_ uses audio frequencies in the
range 1400-1600 Hz for both transmission and reception. Signal frequencies are
therefore above the transceiver’s dial frequency by amounts somewhere in that
200 Hz range. To avoid QRM between the two sub-modes, _WSPR-15_ uses audio 
frequencies in the range 1600-1625 Hz, just above the nominal _WSPR-2_ sub-band.

To operate in the experimental mode, select _WSPR-15_ from the Mode menu.  
The scale in the graphics area will change to show a 25 Hz range that extends
from 1600 to 1625 Hz above the dial frequency.  (If the Rx BFO frequency has 
been set to something other than 1500 Hz on the *Setup | Advanced menu*, the active
Rx frequency range extends from f~BFO~ {plus} 100 to f~BFO~ {plus} 125 Hz.)
As in _WSPR-2_ mode, you can select a Tx frequency by double-clicking at the
appropriate frequency in the graphics area.  In nearly all other ways, _WSPR-15_
operates in the same manner as _WSPR-2_.
