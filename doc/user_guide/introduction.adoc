WSJT is a computer program for amateur VHF/UHF communication using
state-of-the-art digital techniques.  It can help you to make contacts
using fraction-of-a-second signals reflected from meteor trails, as
well as steady signals more than 10 dB below the threshold of
audibility.  Distinct protocols or ``modes'' are provided for
different types of propagation:

[horizontal]

*JTMS*:: For meteor scatter.  Uses minimum-shift keying (MSK) at
1378.125 baud, with a character transmission rate 197 cps.

*FSK441*:: For meteor scatter.  Uses 4-tone frequency-shift keying
(4-FSK) at 441 baud, character transmission rate 147 cps.

*ISCAT*:: Optimized for meteor and ionospheric scatter on 6 meters.
Uses 42-FSK at 21.53 or 43.07 baud, character transmission rate 16.15
or 32.3 cps.

*JT6M*:: Optimized for meteor and ionospheric scatter on 6 meters.  
Uses 44-FSK at 21.53 baud, character transmission rate 14.4 cps.

*JT65*:: For Earth-Moon-Earth (EME, ``moonbounce'') and weak
troposcatter.  Uses structured messages, a Reed-Solomon (63,12)
error-control code (ECC), and 65-FSK modulation at 2.69 baud.
Effective throughput is about 0.25 cps.

*JT4*:: Designed for EME on microwave bands.  Uses structured messages,
a K=32, r=1/2 convolutional code, and 4-FSK modulation at 4.375 baud.
Effective throughput is about 0.25 cps.

*CW*:: For EME using timed, computer-generated transmissions.

*Echo*:: For testing echoes of your own signal from the Moon.
