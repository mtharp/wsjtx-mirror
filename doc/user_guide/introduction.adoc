_{prog}_ (pronounced ``whisper'') stands for Weak Signal Propagation
Reporter.  _WSPR_ implements a protocol designed for probing potential
propagation paths using low-power transmissions. Normal transmissions
carry a station's callsign, grid locator, and transmitter power in
dBm. The program can decode signals with S/N as low as -28 dB in a
2500 Hz bandwidth. Stations with internet access can automatically
upload their reception reports to a central database called {wsprnet},
with a mapping facility, archival storage, and many other features.

Like its sister programs _WSJT_, _MAP65_, _WSJT-X_, and _WSPR-X_,
_{prog}_ is part of an open-source project released under the GNU
General Public License (GPL v3). If you have programming or
documentation skills or would like to contribute to the project in
other ways, please make your interests known to the development
team. The projectâ€™s source-code repository is {devsvn}, and most
communication among the developers takes place on the email reflector
{devmail}.
