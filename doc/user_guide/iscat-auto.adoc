
Beginning with WSJT V10.0 r5639 auto sequencing and auto configure
were added to ISCAT to support transient sporadic E openings on 6m.
This entailed several improvements and modifications to ISCAT 

.*Sequence Lengths*
To take advantage of short Es openings shorter sequence lengths, 
5s and 10s, are available for ISCAT. To change the sequence 
length:  

[literal]
Left click T/R Period:	Move to next higher sequence length
Right click T/R Period:	Move to next lower sequence length 

.*Alternate Messages*
With the Auto Sequencer and the increase in ISCAT activity it is often
desirable to differentiate the source of TX3 - TX5 messages.   WSJT had
an existing alternate message facility that added both calls to the TX3
- TX5 messages.  This feature has been extended to ISCAT.

[literal]
Cntl-G:		Sets alternate style messages (TX3 - TX5 include both calls)
Alt-G:		Sets standard style messages (TX3 - TX5 do not include calls)

Note the message style selection is sticky between sessions of WSJT.

.*Information Block*
With the many options available, Alternate and Standard, Grid or Reports
and several sequence lengths coordination between stations is an issue. 
ISCAT now includes an Information Block as part of the TX1 and TX6 messages.  
This block is used by the auto configuration feature discussed below but can 
also be used to manually set the various options

The structure of the information block is as follows:

[literal]
First Character:			? differentiates the Information block from a grid
Second Character:			S for Standard, A for Alternate style messages
Third Character:			R for Reports, G for Grids
Forth & Fifth Characters:		Sequence Length in Seconds

The Information Block is represented in the message templates with the macro %I
which is only filled in if the mode is ISCAT.  The message templates can edited
to remove %I if it is desired not to use the Information block.  

.*Log QSO Reminder* 
The Auto Sequencer recognizes when the conditions of a complete QSO have been met
and indicates this by flashing the Log QSO button as a reminder.   This can be
cleared with Alt-N, right clicking the Log QSO button or by logging the QSO by
left clicking the Log QSO button.

.*Message Reporting*
In previous releases of WSJT the ISCAT decoder made the decision of which single 
decode of many to pass up to the user and to report.  This has been changed so the
decoder passes all messages to the user and the auto sequencer.  Because the
decoder is capable of producing hundreds of decodes two new Setup options have been
added two manage which messages you will see.

Decodes that were used by the auto sequencer to advance are marked with an 'a' on 
the 31st column of the line, right after the '*' used to indicate messages with 
a strong sync value.  These decodes are also written to all.txt.  

[literal]
Setup/Report All ISCAT Messages:	
If checked this Setup option will show all decoded messages on the text screen and 
place them in all.txt.  This can be hundreds of messages so use sparingly.  Note 
the auto sequencer being active overrides this setting and only the messages used 
by the auto sequencer are displayed.

[literal]
Setup/Hide Empty ISCAT Messages:
When the ISCAT decoder does not decode anything it generates a blank message.  If 
checked this Setup option prevents blank messages from being displayed.

.*Auto Configuration*
With several variations of message type, reports and sequence lengths an auto configuration
feature is active when in ISCAT mode.   It will make a best attempt to configure WSJT based
on a received messaged that is double clicked.   As there are many variations of received 
messages this operation is quite complex.   The following pseudo code shows the auto 
configuration systems reaction to various situations:

[literal]
if First Field equals CQ then 
       Second Field is copied to To Radio
       Third Field is copied to Grid
       if Click was on Forth Field and Forth Field equals valid Information block then
            Set Parameters
       Set TX First based on RX Time and T/R Period
else if First Field equals my call then
       Second Field  is copied to To Radio
       If To Radio in Call3.txt then
            Set Grid to value from call3.txt
       if double click was on Third Field and Third Field equals valid Information block then
            Set Parameters
       Set TX First based on RX Time and T/R Period
else if double click was on First Field
      First Field copied to To Radio
       If To Radio in Call3.txt then
            Set Grid to value from call3.txt
else if double click was on Second Field
       Second Field  is copied to To Radio
       If To Radio in Call3.txt then
            Set Grid to value from call3.txt
else if double click was on Third Field and Third Field equals valid Information block then
            Set Parameters
       Set TX First based on RX Time and T/R Period
	  
.*Auto Sequence*
With the advent of 5s and 10s sequences changes start happening fairly fast.  ISCAT
now has an auto sequencer to deal with this.   Based on the currently transmitted
sequence (TX1 through TX5) the auto sequencer inspects received messages and if 
appropriate advances the TX sequence.

The auto sequencer is active when the TX Auto box is checked and Auto is ON is
active.  

Note that the auto sequencer is highly situational dependent and requires exact
decodes as well as messages matching the message type (standard or alternate) and
report type (grid or report).   If these conditions are not met the auto sequencer
will not advance the TX sequence.

Each segment of each message must match exactly, your call must exactly match the
call you have entered in WSJT, the other stations call must exactly match the call
in To Radio.  In the case of grids as reports the received grid must match the first
4 characters in the Grid field.   In the case of reports the format must be correct
and a reasonability test passed.   In addition all white space must be correct.

In short the auto sequencer will not advance unless everything is exact.  You can
at any time override the auto sequencers decision by clicking on the appropriate 
TXx radio box (to send next TX sequence) or TX title box (to send now).

A problematic issue with auto sequencers is when to stop sending as there is a 
classic Catch 22.  To keep stations from sending forever Setup/Options/Auto 73 Count 
has been added.   The default value of 5 will limit the number of 73 messages sent 
to 5 if the other station is not being heard.  In most instances this will lead to
an elegant shut down of both stations. 

The following pseudo code shows the decision process of the auto sequencer

[literal]
if TX Auto is checked and Auto is On
	if Current TX Sequence equals TX1
		if Received Message equals valid TX1
			Set Signal Report
			Advance to TX2
		else if Received Message equals valid TX2
			Set Signal Report
			Advance to TX3
	else if Current TX Sequence equals TX2
		if Received Message equals valid TX2
			Set Signal Report
			Advance to TX3
		else if Received Message equals valid TX3
			Advance to TX4
	else if Current TX Sequence equals TX3
		if Received Message equals valid TX3
			Advance to TX4
		else if Received Message equals TX4
			Set TXStopCount to Auto73Count
			Advance to TX5
			Set Log QSO to blink
	else if Current TX Sequence equals TX4
		if Received Message equals valid TX4
			Set TXStopCount to Auto73Count
			Advance to TX5
			Set Log QSO to blink
		else if Received Message equals valid TX5
			Set TXStopCount to Auto73Count
			Advance to TX5
			Set Log QSO to blink
	else if Current TX Sequence equals TX5
		if Received Message equals valid TX5
			Set TXStopCount to 0
			Set Auto is ON to Auto is OFF
		else if Received Message equals valid TX4
			Set TXStopCount to Auto73Count
		else
			Decrement TXStopCount
			if TXStopCount equals 0
				Set Auto is ON to Auto is OFF
