=== Transceiver Setup
.Receiver Noise Level

- Turn on your radio, select *USB* (or *USB Data*) mode, and tune to a
clear frequency so that only background noise is sent to the sound
card.

- If necessary, click the *Monitor* button on the _WSJT_ main window
to start normal receive operation.  The button should be highlighted in
[green]*GREEN*. 

- Open the operating system's audio mixer and adjust its slider and/or
your receiver gain control(s) to bring the signal level close to what
_WSJT_ considers ``0 dB,'' as indicated on the bar graph at lower
right of the *SpecJT* screen.  The signal level is also displayed
as *Rx noise* on the status bar at bottom of the main window.

.Transmitter Audio Level

- Click *Generate messages for test tones* on the *Setup* menu.

- Click the *Tx5* button to be sure that T/R switching works and that
a continuous 1000 Hz audio tone is sent from the computer to your
radio.

- Listen to the generated audio tone using your radio's *Monitor*
facility. The transmitted tone should be smooth and continuous, with no
clicks or glitches.

- Adjust the appropriate slider on the operating system's audio mixer
to get the proper audio signal level for your transmitter.

- Click *Tx Stop* to end your test transmission. 

_WSJT_ should now be set up and ready to operate.  If you are a new
_WSJT_ user, we strongly recommend that you work through the operating
tutorial in the next section.

CAUTION: Full amplitude transmissions lasting 30 seconds or longer put
more stress on your final amplifier than SSB or CW operation.  If this
would cause the amplifier to overheat, reduce power or provide better
cooling.

.Minimal QSO Information
By longstanding tradition, a minimal valid QSO requires the exchange
of callsigns, a signal report or some other information, and
acknowledgments.  _WSJT_ is designed to facilitate making such minimal
QSOs under difficult conditions, and the process can be made easier if
you follow standard operating practices.  The recommended procedure is
as follows:

. If you have received less than both calls from the other station,
send both calls.

. If you have received both calls, send both calls and a signal report.

. If you have received both calls and a report, send R plus your
signal report.

. If you have received R plus signal report, send RRR.

. If you have received RRR -- that is, a definite acknowledgment of
all of your information -- the QSO is complete.  However, the other
station may not know this, so it is conventional to send 73 (or some
other conversational information) to signify that you are done.

Slightly different procedures may be used in different parts of the
world, or in the different operating modes.  Hitting the *F5* key will
cause _WSJT_ to display a screen that reminds you of the recommended
procedures.

.QSO Procedures
To prepare for making a QSO, enter the other station's callsign in the
*To radio* box and click *Lookup* and *Gen Msgs* to generate a
sequence of the commonly used messages.  If *Lookup* does not find the
callsign in the database file CALL3.TXT, you may enter the grid
locator manually.  Decide whether you or the other station will
transmit first, and check or uncheck *Tx First* appropriately.  Select
the message for your next transmission by clicking the small circle
to the right of the message text.  Toggle *Auto ON* to start an
automatic sequence of transmission and reception intervals.  You can
switch messages while a transmission is in progress by clicking on one
of the buttons *Tx1* to *Tx6*, to the right of the circles.

Spectral information is displayed in real time on the *SpecJT* screen.
Spectrograms normally scroll horizontally in the fast modes (FSK441,
JTMS, ISCAT, and JT6M) and vertically in the slow modes (JT65 and
JT4). You can choose different scrolling speeds at the top right of
the *SpecJT* window.

At the end of each receiving period, _WSJT_ enters a decode cycle and
displays various properties of a received signal on the main screen.
An example for JT6M mode is shown below.  A green line in the main
graphical area illustrates signal strength vs. time, and other lines
or images display spectral information and synchronization results,
depending on the mode.

image::images/jt6m.png[align="center"]

Decoded text appears in the large box below the graphical area and is
also written to a cumulative output file, +ALL.TXT+.  The program's
best estimate of *DF*, a detected signal's frequency offset, is
included on each text line.  The accuracy of these estimates depends
on the mode: approximately ±7 Hz for JTMS signals, ±25 Hz for
FSK441, ±20 Hz for ISCAT and JT6M, and ±3 Hz for JT65.  Within these
tolerances (and subject to the stability of oscillators and the
propagation path) you should see consistent numbers in the *DF* column
during any QSO that produces usable signals.

Double-clicking on a callsign in either one of the decoded text
windows will cause that callsign to be copied into the *To radio* box.
The corresponding *Grid* locator will be looked up in the database and
the callsign inserted in Tx message boxes #1 and #2.  If the decoded
text line includes CQ before the selected callsign, message #1 will
be selected for your next transmission.  Otherwise, #2 will be
selected.  If *Double-click on callsign sets TxFirst* was checked on
the *Setup* menu, the status of *Tx First* is set according to the
time-stamp on the decoded message.

=== Fast Modes

The JTMS, FSK441, ISCAT, and JT6M operating modes use 30-second
periods (optionally, 15-second periods) for transmission and
reception.  When a reception interval is completed the program looks
for signal enhancements produced by short-lived reflections from
meteor trails, or signal peaks from other types of scatter
propagation.  Usable ``pings'' are audible when they occur, and you
will see them as spikes on the green line and brighter colors in the
scrolling spectrogram.  One or more lines of decoded text may result
from each ping.  By clicking in the graphical area you can force a
decoding attempt at a particular spot in a record.  You can also make
the program decode in real time, just after hearing a signal
enhancement, by clicking on the appropriate spot in the SpecJT
display.

_WSJT_ attempts to compensate for relative mistuning between
transmitting and receiving stations.  By default the frequency search
range is ±400 Hz. You can reduce the tolerance range by setting the
value of *Tol* to a smaller value.  Adjustments to the decoding
parameters can be made at any time by right- or left-clicking on the
parameter labels. The control labeled *S* or *Sync* sets the minimum
level for acceptable signals.

In FSK441 mode, if *DF* lies outside the range ±100 Hz it will help
to retune your receiver to compensate.  Do this with your
transceiver's RIT control, or by using split Rx/Tx VFOs.  In the JTMS,
ISCAT, and JT6M modes you can accomplish the same effect by checking
*Freeze* and using the keyboard right/left arrows to move *Freeze DF*
(as displayed in the bottom-of-screen status bar) to the desired
value.  In general you should not change your transmitting frequency
during a QSO, since your partner will be trying to tune you in at the
same time.

In addition to the green line for overall signal strength, JT6M
produces a yellow line showing the detected strength of a JT6M
synchronizing tone (see illustration above).  JT6M attempts to decode
both individual enhancements and an average message based on the
entire transmission (or selected portions thereof).  An average message
is flagged with an asterisk at the right end of the decoded text line.
Clicking with the left mouse button decodes a 4 s block of data near
the mouse pointer, while the right button decodes a 10 s segment.  As
in FSK441, with marginal signals you should experiment as necessary
for best decoding.  ISCAT and JT6M can work with signals many dB
weaker than those required for JTMS and FSK441.  You will sometimes
find that clicking on a smooth green line, even where nothing was
heard and nothing can be seen, causes callsigns or other information
to pop up out of the noise.

Standard messages in the fast modes are generated with the aid of
templates defined on the *Setup | Options* screen.  Default templates
are provided conforming to standard operating practices in North
America and Europe, and you can edit the templates to suit your own
requirements.  Your edits will be saved on program termination and
restored when you restart _WSJT_.  Normal fast-mode messages can
contain any arbitrary text up to 28 characters.  The supported
character set includes 0-9, A-Z, plus . , / # ? $ and <space>.

JTMS and FSK441 provide a special shorthand format to transmit four
simple messages in a highly efficient way.  The supported shorthands
are R26, R27, RRR, and 73; FSK441 and JTMS send pure tones at 882,
1323, 1764, or 2205 Hz to convey these messages. If activity levels
are high enough that there could be some doubt about who has
transmitted a shorthand message, it is better to use normal messages
tagged with callsigns or portions thereof.  Check *Rx ST* and *Tx ST*
enable single-tone messages.

A typical minimal QSO in one of the fast modes might look something
like the sequence of transmissions below.  You should step ahead to
the next message in your sequence only when you have received your QSO
partner's information from his sequence.

-----
  1.  CQ K1ABC
  2.                     K1ABC W9XYZ
  3.  W9XYZ K1ABC 27 
  4.                     K1ABC W9XYZ R26 
  5.  W9XYZ K1ABC RRR
  6.                     K1ABC W9XYZ 73
-----

In North America, shorthand messages R26, RRR and 73 are often
substituted for messages 4, 5, and 6, so the QSO would proceed
like this:
 
-----
  1.  CQ K1ABC
  2.                     K1ABC W9XYZ
  3.  W9XYZ K1ABC 27 
  4.                     R26 
  5.  RRR
  6.                     73
-----


=== Slow Modes

JT65 and JT4, the slow modes in _WSJT-X_, aim to facilitate minimal
QSOs by using short structured messages.  The process works best if
you use these formats and follow standard operating practices.  The
recommended basic QSO goes something like this:

-----
  1.  CQ K1ABC FN42
  2.                    K1ABC G0XYZ IO91
  3.  G0XYZ K1ABC -19
  4.                    K1ABC G0XYZ R-22
  5.  G0XYZ K1ABC RRR
  6.                    K1ABC G0XYZ 73
-----

*Standard messages* consist of two callsigns (or CQ, QRZ, or DE and
one callsign) followed by the transmitting station's grid locator, a
signal report, R plus a signal report, or the final acknowledgements
RRR or 73. JT65 and JT4 compress and encode these standard messages in
a highly efficient way, and strong error-control coding makes them
very reliable.  In uncompressed form they may contain as many as 18
characters.

*Signal reports* are specified as signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in dB,
using a standard reference noise bandwidth of 2500 Hz.  Thus, in
example message #3 above, K1ABC is telling G0XYZ that his signal is 19
dB below the noise power in bandwidth 2500 Hz.  In message #4, G0XYZ
acknowledges receipt and responds with a -22 dB signal report.  JT65
reports are constrained to lie in the range -30 to -1 dB, while JT9
supports the extended range -50 to +49 dB.

*Shorthand messages* are transmitted in JT65 as a sequence of
alternating tones, repeating approximately every 3 seconds.  Different
tone spacings correspond to the shorthand messages RO, RRR, and 73;
these messages can be easily recognized on the waterfall and also by
ear.  EME QSOs often use the shorthand messages, and in that case a
typical QSO proceeds like this:

-----
  1.  CQ K1ABC FN42
  2.                        K1ABC G0XYZ IO91
  3.  G0XYZ K1ABC FN42 OOO
  4.                        RO
  5.  RRR
  6.                        73
-----

*Free text messages* are often used to convey some friendly chit-chat
at the end of a QSO.  Arbitrary messages such as ``TNX ROBERT 73'' or
``5W VERT 73 GL'' are supported, up to a maximum of 13 characters
(including spaces).  It should be obvious that the JT9 and JT65
protocols are not well suited for extensive conversations or
rag-chewing.

*Compound callsigns* such as xxx/K1ABC or K1ABC/x are handled in one of
two possible ways.  A list of about 350 of the most common prefixes
and suffixes can be displayed from the *Help* menu:

image::images/prefixes.png[align="center"]

A single compound callsign involving one item from this list can be
used instead of a third message word in a structured message.  Thus,
the following examples are all acceptable *Type 1* messages involving
compound callsigns:

-----
  CQ ZA/K1ABC
  CQ K1ABC/4
  ZA/K1ABC G0XYZ
  G0XYZ K1ABC/4
-----

The following messages are _not_ valid, because a third word is not
permitted in a *Type 1* compound-callsign message:

-----
  ZA/K1ABC G0XYZ -22        #These messages will be sent
  G0XYZ K1ABC/4 73          #without the third "word"
-----

A QSO involving a station using a *Type 1* compound callsign might
look like this:

-----
  1.  CQ ZA/K1ABC
  2.                      ZA/K1ABC G0XYZ
  3.  G0XYZ K1ABC -19
  4.                      K1ABC G0XYZ R-22
  5.  G0XYZ K1ABC RRR
  6.                      K1ABC G0XYZ 73
-----

Notice that both operators send and receive the full compound
callsign in their first transmission.  After that, they omit the
add-on prefix or suffix and use the standard structured messages
and base callsigns.

*Type 2* compound callsigns involve a prefix or suffix _not_ found in
the short displayable list.  In that case the compound callsign must
be the second word in a two- or three-word message, the first word of
which must be CQ, DE, or QRZ.  Prefixes can be 1 to 4 alphanumeric
characters, suffixes 1 to 3 characters.  A third word conveying a
locator, signal report, RRR, or 73 is permitted.  The following are
valid *Type 2* messages with compound callsigns:

-----
  CQ W4/G0XYZ FM07
  DE W4/G0XYZ -22
  QRZ K1ABC/VE6 DO33
-----

In each case, the message is treated as *Type 2* because the add-on
prefix or suffix is _not_ one of those in the fixed list displayed
above.  Note that a second callsign is never permissible in 
messages involvinf *Type 2* compound callsigns.

QSOs involving *Type 2* compound callsigns might look like one
of the following sequences

-----
1.  CQ KP4/K1ABC FK68
2.                      K1ABC G0XYZ IO91
3.  G0XYZ K1ABC -19
4.                      K1ABC G0XYZ R-22
5.  G0XYZ K1ABC RRR
6.                      K1ABC G0XYZ 73
-----


-----
1.  CQ K1ABC FN42
2.                      DE G0XYZ/W4 FM18
3.  G0XYZ K1ABC -19
4.                      K1ABC G0XYZ R-22
5.  G0XYZ K1ABC RRR
6.                      DE G0XYZ/W4 73
-----

Each operator sends his own compound callsign in the first (and
possibly also last) transmission, as may be required by licensing
authorities.  Subsequent transmissions use the standard structured
messages without callsign prefix or suffix.

IMPORTANT: It's up to you, the operator, to ensure that messages with
compound callsigns are composed in the manner described above.
Double-clicking on a line of decoded text may not always produce the
expected result.

TIP: During a transmission your transmitted message is always
displayed in the first label on the *Status Bar*, highlighted in
color, displayed exactly as another station will receive it.  You can
also experiment with compound callsigns using the <<UTILITIES,utility
programs>> +jt65code+ and +jt4code+.
 
=== JT4 at Microwaves

To get the best out of JT4 on the upper microwave bands (in particular
10 and 24 GHz), it has been found advantageous to use single tones for
simple messages such as RRR and 73, after callsigns have been
exchanged.  For this to work unambiguously, high frequency accuracy
and stability are needed.  This can be accomplished using GPS locking
and automatic Doppler correction on the EME path, as described in
http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/small_station_eme.pdf.
The recommended mode for 10 and 24 GHz is JT4F.  The exchange of
numerical signal reports in dB is also encouraged, to ensure that
unknown information is exchanged.

You can transmit a pure tone at frequency XXXX by entering +@XXXX+ in
the active TX box.  The resulting signal has all its energy at a
single frequency, so much easier to see on the waterfall.  With good
calibration the frequency can be read directly from the waterfall.
Once one aligns on the 1270 Hz +TUNE+ tone and checks Freeze on the
main window there will be two red ticks on the waterfall, marking the
RRR and 73 messages.  _WSJT_ also provides a facility to integrate
spectra over a full transmission, to gain a further sensitivity
improvement.  Check *Plot average JT4 spectrum* on the *Setup* menu.

Single tones and their meanings are as follows:

[horizontal]
*1270 Hz*:: Tuning tone 
*1000 Hz*:: please send messages
*1500 Hz*:: RRR
*1700 Hz*:: 73
*2000 Hz*:: QRT

You can insert these frequently used tones as templates on the
*Setup | Options* window:

image::images/jt4_Templates.png[align="center"]

One small quirk is that if you double right click on the other
station's callsign to pick up the report this will return the format
to the standard (non-single tone) arrangement.  This is readily
overcome by clicking on Gen Msgs when one is ready to TX single tones.

This procedure has also proved effective for terrestrial contacts
using JT4F on tropo-scatter, ducting, and rain-scatter.  

.Setting *MinW*

The *MinW* parameter allows settings of A to F.  The letters represent
Doppler-spread widths corresponding to tone spacings of the JT4
submodes:

.Parameters of WSJT Fast Modes
[width="40%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|==================================
|Letter	|Width (Hz)
|A	|4.4
|B	|8.8
|C	|17.5
|D	|39.4
|E	|78.8
|F	|157.5
|G	|315
|==================================

The JT4 decoder tests increasing bin-widths, starting from the letter
set in *MinW*, to optimize decoding in relation to Doppler spread.
It's generally best to set *MinW* one or two steps below the predicted
full spreading, which for EME is available in the *Astronomical Data*
window.  If the antenna beamwidth is smaller than the moon, actual
spreading will be less.

False decodes are rare at microwave frequencies, where there is little
man-made noise.  You can safely set *Sync* to 0 to allow the program to 
synchronize on the weakest signals.

=== CW Mode

The _WSJT_ CW mode is provided as a convenience for operators
attempting EME contacts using timed transmissions of 1, 2, or 2.5
minutes duration. The program sends EME-style messages by keying an
800 Hz audio tone, and takes care of the timing and T/R
switching. Receiving is left up to you, the operator. Set the desired
CW speed under *Miscellaneous* on the *Setup | Options* window, and
the T/R period by right- or left-clicking on the label at bottom
center of the main window. Present conventions typically use 1 minute
sequences on 50 MHz, either 1 or 2 minutes on 144 MHz, and 2.5 minutes
on 432 MHz and above.
