.KVASD Installation

All Linux users must install a companion program called +kvasd+, an
implementation of the the Koetter-Vardy algebraic soft-decision
decoder for the Reed Solomon (63,12) code.  Users of Ubuntu and other
Debian-based systems can install +kvasd+ by executing the following
commands in a terminal:

 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ki7mt/kvasd-installer
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install kvasd-installer
 kvasd-installer

The final screen of the installer should include the line

 KVASD version 1.12 -- Decode test *** PASSED ***

which should also be displayed if the command

 kvasd -v

is executed after installation is complete.

You can install +kvasd+ on most Linux systems (including ARM-based
systems) by downloading, unpacking, and executing the simple tools
packaged in the +kvasd-installer+ script.  Your system will need the 
following standard tools already installed: 

 autoconf awk bash dialog libgfortran svn

Download the {kvasd_installer} tarfile to a convenient directory, then
execute the following commands in a terminal there:

 tar xzf kvasd-installer-1.12.14.tar.gz
 cd kvasd-installer-1.12.14
 ./autogen.sh
 sudo make install
 kvasd-installer

As described above, the final screen of the installer should include
the line

 KVASD version 1.12 -- Decode test *** PASSED ***
