Some special-purpose applications can benefit from a simple
implementation of the WSPR protocol in a program driven from the
command line.  The standard _{prog}_ 4.0 distribution includes a
simple program _WSPR0_ for this purpose.  As distributed, _WSPR0_
always uses the system default audio devices and it does not implement
automatic uploading of spots, rig control, I/Q mode, or band hopping.
The program runs in a single thread. Its source code is easy to modify
as desired for particular applications. Full operational details are
described in an accompanying document, {wspr0_guide}.
