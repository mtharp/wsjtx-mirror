=== VHF Setup

V1.6.0 is the first _WSJT-X_ version to include features specifically
designed for use on VHF and higher bands.  These features include *JT4*,
a mode particularly useful for EME on the microwave bands; *Echo* mode,
for detecting and measuring your own lunar echoes; and automatic
*Doppler tracking* for the EME path.  (Note that sub-modes JT65B and
JT65C are present in v1.6.0, but are not yet fully implemented for EME
purposes.)

- To activate the VHF-and-up features check the box labeled _Enable
  VHF/UHF/Microwave features_ on the *Settings | General* tab.

- If you will be doing EME, check the box _Decode at t = 52 s_
to allow for the EME path delay on received signals.

- If you will use automatic Doppler tracking, check the box _Allow Tx
frequency changes while transmitting_.  On the *Radio* tab select
_Split Operation_ (use either _Rig_ or _Fake It_: you might need to
experiment with both).

IMPORTANT: Not all transceivers permit computer adjustments of Tx
frequency while transmitting.  Among those that do are the IC-735,
IC-756 Pro II, IC-910-H, FT-847, TS-2000 (with Rev 9 firmware
upgrade), Flex 1500 and 5000, HPSDR, Anan-10, Anan-100, and KX3.

- The main window reconfigures itself as necessary to include controls
supporting features of each mode.  For example, in JT4 mode the
central part of the main window will look like this:

- On the *View* menu, select *Astronomical data* to display a window
with important information for tracking the Moon and performing
automatic Doppler control.

IMPORTANT: Note that two different types of Doppler control are provided.  

- Select _Full Doppler to DX Grid_ if you know your QSO partner's locator
and he/she is not using Doppler control.

- Select _Constant frequency on Moon_ to correct for your own (one-way)
Doppler shift to or from the Moon.  If your QSO partner does the same
thing, both stations will have the required Doppler compensation.
Moreover, anyone else using this option will hear both of you
without the need for manual frequency changes.  The hypothetical ``man
in the moon'' will copy all of you on the selected nominal frequency:
in the example depicted above, this is 100 kHz above the stated band
edge, e.g., 10368.100 MHz for the 10 GHz band.

- Spinner controls at top right of the Astronomical Data window let you
set a working frequency above the nominal band edge. The frequency above
band edge is the sum of the numbers in these two controls (kHz + Hz).

=== EME with JT4

- Select *JT4* from the *Mode* menu.

- Select the desired submode, which determines the tone spacing.
Higher spacings are used on the higher microwave bands, to allow for
larger Doppler spreads. For example, JT4F is generally used for EME on
the 10 GHz band.

- If using a transverter, set the appropriate offset on the
*Settings | Frequencies* tab.  Offset is defined as (desired
transceiver dial reading) minus (desired on-the-air frequency).  For
example, when using a 144 MHz radio at 10368 MHz, 
offset = (144 - 10368) = -10224.000.  Right-click anywhere inside the 
_Station Information_ box, select the desired band, and enter the 
offset number.

- The JT4 decoder in _WSJT-X_ includes optional facilities for
averaging over successive trandmissions and also correlation decoding,
sometimesknown as ``Deep Search''.  The *Decode* menu appears to
provide options to set different decoding behavior.  However, in JT4 mode
this program version always behaves as if you have selected _Include
correlation_.

- By convention, EME with JT4 can use ``short form'' messages.  To
activate automatic generation of these messages, check the box labeled
_Sh_ on the main window.

IMPORTANT: Many additional hints for using JT4 and Echo mode on the
EME path are available here:

=== Echo Mode

*Echo* mode allows you to make sensitive measurements of your own
lunar echoes, even when they are too weak to be heard. Select *Echo*
from the *Mode* menu, aim your antenna at the moon, pick a clear
frequency, and toggle click *Tx Enable*. _WSJT-X_ will then cycle
through the following loop every 6 seconds:

1. Transmit a fixed tone for 2.3 s
2. Wait about 0.2 s for start of the return echo
3. Record the received signal for 2.3 s
4. Analyze, average, and display the results
5. Repeat from step 1

To make a sequence of echo tests:

- Select *Echo* from the *Mode* menu.

- On the Astronomical Data window check _Doppler tracking_ and
_Constant frequency on the Moon_

- Choose your desired test frequency using the _Frequency above nominal
band edge_ controls.

- Click *Enable Tx* on the main window to start a sequence of 6-second
cycles.

- _WSJT-X_ calculates and compensates for Doppler shift automatically.
Your return echo should always appear at the center of the plot area
on the Echo Graph window.
