A number of WSJT users have put hundreds of hours into using and
testing _WSJT_, finding bugs, and suggesting improvements.  
Particular thanks are due to G3WDG, G4DEZ, G4IGO, IK0BZY, IK0SMG,
IW4ARD, K0AWU, KI7MT, N5SIX, OE5MPL, OZ1PIF, VK3SO, VK4JMC, VK7MO,
W5WVO, W8WN, and WA5UFH.  

Special thanks are also due to Ralf Koetter and Alexander Vardy, whose
research paper ``Soft-Decision Algebraic Decoding of Reed Solomon
Codes,''( _IEEE Transactions on Information Theory_,'' vol. 49,
pp. 2809-2825, 2003) introduced me to the powerful decoding algorithm
now used in the JT65 modes.  Through their company CodeVector
technologies, Koetter and Vardy granted a license to use their
algorithm, protected under United States patent 6,634,007, for
noncommercial purposes in amateur radio, and to adapt their computer
code to this end.
