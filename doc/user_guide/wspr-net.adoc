To access the features of {wsprnet}, point your browser to
+wsprnet.org+. This excellent web site is designed and maintained by
Bruce Walker, W1BW.  It provides a chat facility, band-by-band counts
of stations reporting or spotted in the past ten minutes, a world map
showing active _{prog}_ stations and open propagation paths, an
interface to the historical database, and statistical summaries
derived from the data. The map can be zoomed and panned, and you can
set various criteria to determine what spots are shown.  An example of
the world-wide map is shown below:
