.Main Window:
- Select *FT8* on the *Mode* menu.
- Set Tx and Rx frequencies to 1200 Hz.
- Double-click on *Erase* to clear both text windows.

.Wide Graph Settings:

- *Bins/Pixel* = 4, *Start* = 200 Hz, *N Avg* = 2
- Adjust the width of the Wide Graph window so that the upper
frequency limit is approximately 2600 Hz.

.Open a Wave File:

- Select *File | Open* and navigate to
+...\save\samples\FT8\170709_135615.wav+.  The waterfall and decoded
text window should look something like the following screen shots:

- Click with the mouse anywhere on the waterfall display. The green Rx
frequency marker will jump to your selected frequency, and the Rx
frequency control on the main window will be updated accordingly.

- Do the same thing with the Shift key held down.  Now the red Tx
frequency marker and its associated control on the main window will
follow your frequency selections.

- Do the same thing with the Ctrl key held down.  Now the both colored 
markers and both spinner controls will follow your selections.

- Double-clicking at any frequency on the waterfall does all the
things just described and also invokes the decoder in a small range
around that frequency.  To decode a particular signal, double-click
near the left edge of its waterfall trace.

- Now double-click on any of the the lines of decoded text in the main
window.  Unless you have *My Call* set to K1JT or KY7M on the
*Settings -> General* tab, all three lines will show the same
behavior, setting both RxFreq and TxFreq to the frequency of the
selected message.  However, if MyCall is set to K1JT then clicking on
a message directed to K1JT will move only the Rx frequency setting.
This behavior is desirable so that you will not inadvertently change
your Tx frequency to that of a tail-ender who called you somewhere
else in the FT8 subband.

NOTE: The FT8 decoder can often copy several overlapping signals at
nearly the same frequency.  However, in crowded band conditions you
will often find it advantageous to move off the frequency of the
station you are calling.  Keyboard shortcuts *Shift+F11* and
*Shift+F12* provide an easy way to move your Tx frequency in 60 Hz
steps.

NOTE: Further helpful tips on FT8 operating procedures are available

IMPORTANT: When finished with this Tutorial, don't forget to re-enter
your own callsign as *My Call* on the *Settings | General* tab.
