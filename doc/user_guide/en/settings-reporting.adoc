- _Logging_: Choose any desired options from this group.  Operators in
a multi-operator station may wish to enter their home callsign as *Op
Call*.

- _Network Services_: Check *Enable PSK Reporter Spotting* to send
reception reports to the {pskreporter} mapping facility.

- _UDP Server_: This group of options controls the network name or
address and port number used by a program that will receive status
updates from _WSJT-X_.  Cooperating applications like _JTAlert_ use
this feature to obtain information about a running _WSJT-X_ instance.
If you are using _JTAlert_, be sure to check the three boxes at lower
right.

- _N1MM Logger+ Broadcasts_: To send information on logged QSOs
directly to _N1MM Logger+_, check the box and enter the IP address and
port number for _N1MM_.
