_JT65 decoding parameters_ 

- *Random erasure patterns* sets the number of pseudo-random trials
used by the Franke-Taylor decoder, on a logarithmic scale.  Larger
numbers give slightly better sensitivity but take longer.  For most
purposes a good setting is 6 or 7.

- *Aggressive decoding level* sets the threshold for acceptable
decodes using Deep Search.  Higher numbers will display more results 
with relatively low confidence levels.

- Check the *Two-pass decoding* box to enable a second decoding pass
after signals producing first-pass decodes have been subtracted
from the received data.

_Miscellaneous_

- Set a positive number for *Degrade S/N of .wav file* to add known
amounts of pseudo-random noise to data read from a .wav file
previously saved by _WSJT_ or _WSJT-X_.  To ensure that the resulting
S/N degradation is close to that requested, set *Receiver bandwidth* to
your best estimate of the receiver's effective noise bandwidth.

- Set *Tx delay* to a number larger than the default 0.2 s to create
a larger delay between execution of a command to enable PTT and onset
of Tx audio.  

IMPORTANT: For the health of your T/R relays and external
preamplifier, we strongly recommend using a hardware sequencer and
testing to make sure that sequencing is correct.

- Check the box *x 2 Tone spacing* to generate Tx audio with twice the
normal tone spacing.  This feature is intended for use with specialized
LF/MF transmitters that divide the audio waveform by 2 before further
processing.
