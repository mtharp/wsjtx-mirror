=== New in Version 1.7

For quick reference, here's a short list of features and capabilities
added to _WSJT-X_ since Version 1.6.0:

- New modes: ISCAT, MSK144, QRA64

- Newly implemented submodes: JT65B-C, JT9B-H

- New fast submodes of JT9E-H

- New Franke-Taylor decoder to replace the Koetter-Vardy decoder in
JT65. Separate program `kvasd[.exe]` is no longer used.

- Improvements to the JT4, JT9, and JT65 decoders

subtracted out, allowing the decoding of weaker signals.

- Many corrections and improvements to the Hamlib library, fixing
balky rig-control features
