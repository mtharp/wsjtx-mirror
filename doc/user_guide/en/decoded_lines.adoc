Displayed information accompanying decoded messages generally includes UTC,
signal-to-noise ratio in dB, time offset DT in seconds, and
audio frequency in Hz.  Some modes include additional information such
as frequency offset from nominal (DF), frequency drift (Drift or F1),
or distance (km or mi).

There may also be some cryptic characters with special meanings
summarized in the following Table:
