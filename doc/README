This folder  contains the sources  of WSJT-X documentation.   To build
these you will need the asciidoc and Python v2 tools installed.

If you do not wish to build  the documentation, it is possible to skip
this  directory  in the  WSJT-X  build  by  setting the  CMake  option
WSJT_GENERATE_DOCS to OFF in your build tree.


On Linux
========

You will probably have these installed already if you are building the
WSJT-X  manpages,  if you  are  not  you  will  just need  to  install
asciidoc:

 sudo apt-get install asciidoc

or

 sudo yum install asciidoc

or whatever your distribution and package management requires.


On Mac OS X
===========

I recommend MacPorts:

 sudo port install asciidoc


On Windows
==========

The asciidoc  tool is a  Python script so you  will need to  install a
version of  Python v2. If  you already have  Python v3 as  the default
Python interpreter on your system  then download and install Python v2
(probably v2.7.x) but  adjust the installer options so as  not to make
it  the  default  system  Python   interpreter,  this  is  normally  a
configuration option in the MSI installer.

The current  version of asciidoc (8.6.9)  is broken on Windows  so you
will need to get the latest development version:

 download https://github.com/asciidoc/asciidoc/archive/master.zip

and unzip  it somewhere like  C:\Tools then you  will need to  add the
path to asciidoc and possibly Python  v2 to your CMake tool chain file
for building WSJT-X. The directory  containing asciidoc.py needs to be
included in the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH variable.
