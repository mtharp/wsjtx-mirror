== NAME

wspr0 - limited command-line WSPR

== SYNOPSIS

*wspr0* [OPTIONS]


== DESCRIPTION

*'wspr0'* is a simple command-line version of *'WSPR'* with no frills,
no graphics and no GUI.  Many advanced features of the full WSPR
program, including I/Q mode, frequency hopping, and automatic
uploading of spots to <www.wsprnet.org>, are not included. *wspr0* is
intended for specialized uses where its easy compilation, small memory
requirements can be advantageous.


== OPTIONS

*-t*::
	Run in 100% Tx mode. (Default is Rx mode.)

*-b*::
	Pseudo-random selection of Rx and Tx cycles.

*-D* file1.wav file1.wav::
	Open and decode one or more wav files.

*-m*::
	Run in WSPR-15 mode (default is WSPR-2)

*-n* n::
	Number of files to be generated

*-o* outfile::
	Output filename overrides default nnnnnn.

*-p* n::
	PTT port
*-P* n::
	Transmitting percent (default=25)

*-s* x::
	SNR of generated data, dB (default 100)

*-x*::
	Generate test file(s) with 10 signals in each

*-X*::
	Generate list of audio tones for this message

== DEFAULTS

By default, the 'callsign', 'grid locator' and 'power-level'
for the transmitted message are taken from file *wspr0.def*.
These may be overridden by using the following options:

*-c* call::
	Your stations call sign

*-g* grid::
	4 Digit grid location

*-d* dBm::
	Your transmit power, in dbm


== FREQUENCIES

*-f* x::
	Transceiver dial frequency is x (MHz)

*-F* x::
	Center frequency of transmission is x (MHz)

*-a* x::
	Audio frequency of transmission is x (Hz)

== EXAMPLES
-----
wspr0 -t                      # Transmit default message
wspr0 -t -s -22 -o test.wav   # Generate a test file
wspr0 -t -s -25 -n 3          # Generate three test files
wspr0 -b                      # Randomized T/R sequences
wspr0 -f 14.0956              # Rx only, on 20m::
wspr0 -D 00001.wav 00002.wav  # Decode these two files
