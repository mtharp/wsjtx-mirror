== NAME

wspr - Weak Signal Propagation Reporter


== SYNOPSIS

*wpsr*, *wspr0* [OPTIONS], *fmt* [OPTIONS], *fmtave* [FILE], *fcal* [FILE],
*fmeasure*	[FILE]

== PROGRAMS

There are (6) programs associated with *WSPR*:

*WSPR* - (pronounced "whisper") stands for "Weak Signal Propagation
Reporter". The WSPR software is designed for probing potential radio
propagation paths using low-power beacon-like transmissions. *WSPR* does
not take command-line auguemnts, simply run the applicaiton and setup your
stations parameters.

*WSPR0* - is a simple command-line version of WSPR with no frills,
no graphics and no GUI.  Many advanced features of the full WSPR
program, including I/Q mode, frequency hopping, and automatic
uploading of spots to WSPRnet.org, are not included.  *wspr0* is 
intended for specialized uses where its easy compilation, small memory
requirements, etc., can be advantageous.

*FMT* - Sets the dial frequency of a CAT-controlled radio and performs
a sequence of measurements for the strongest resulting audio tone near a 
specified offset frequency. Input parameters are taken from the command line,
and output goes to files fmt.out and fmt.all. The latter file is cumulative.

*FMTAVE* - Averages data found in a specified file having the format of fmt.all

*FCAL* - Calculates a best-fit straight line for a data saved in fmtave.out.
Results are saved in file fcal.out.

*FMEASURE* - Calculates the properly calibrated frequency of each test signal
found in file fmtave.out. Results are saved in file fmeasure.out, and these
are the numbers you should report if you are entering the Frequency Measuring
Test.
