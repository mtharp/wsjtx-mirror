Installation Instructions for WSPR 4.0
--------------------------------------

The following is a brief installation guide using Linux as the example. WSPR
can be built on Windows (using MinGW+MSYS / JTSDK-PY), Mac OSX 10.6/7,
and most Linux variants, provided the dependencies are met.

REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES
---------------------
To compile WSPR, as a minimum, you will need the following:

	* A C/C++ and gfortran compiler
	* GNU Autotools: autoconf, make
	* Portaudio-19-dev
	* FFTW 3.3+-dev
	* Samplerate Development Library.
	* Python3.2+
	* Numeric Python (Numpy), provides F2PY-3.2+
	* PIL, (Python Imaging Library)
	* Python-tk (Tcl\TK 8.6.1 or Later)
	* Hamlib 1.2.15.x (or current distro verson

NOTE: Where possible, install development header packages. Consult your
distribuntion documentation for package names.

Example: For Ubuntu 14.04, install the following:

sudo apt-get install autoconf autotools build-essential gfortran libtool \
libtool libfftw3-dev libgfortran3:i386 libusb-dev libhamlib-dev libhamlib-utils \
libsamplerate0-dev portaudio19-dev python3-setuptools python3-dev python3-imaging \
python3-imaging-tk python3-pip python3-tk python3-numpy texinfo


INSTALL PREFIX
--------------
The default install location is /usr/local. You can change the
install locaiton using the following configuration parameter:

Example:

./configure --prefix=/home/$USER/wspr


NON-STANDARD LIBRARY LOCATIONS
------------------------------
The configure script will search standard Linux header and library locaitons
for FFTW3, Samplerate and Portaudio19. If it cannot locate and test the 
required packages, you will be prompted to supply the locations:

Example:

./configure --with-portaudio-lib-dir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
--with-portaudio-include-dir=/usr/include


DUAL-PYTHON SYSTEMS
--------------------
On dual Python systems, you need to specify Python3 and F2PY3 locations:

Example:

./configure PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3 F2PY=/usr/local/bin/f2py3


CONFIGURE && MAKE
-----------------
To configure and build WSPR, type the following:


./autogen.sh


Note: You can re-run ./configure any time after a sucessfull ./autogen.sh run.
To see available configure options, type:

./configure --help


RUN WPSR
--------

python3 -O wspr.py


MAKE INSTALL
------------
To install WSPR system wide (for all users):

sudo make install

or

root make install


CLEAN THE BUILD TREE
--------------------
make clean


CLEAN FOR DISTRIBUTION
----------------------
make distclean


BASIC MAC OSX INSTALLATION INSTUCTIONS (Example 10.7)
-----------------------------------------------------

You need to be familiar with command line operations using
the Terminal window and with downloading and installing
libraries.

Apple provide python 2.x as part of the system but this must
be upgraded to python 3.4.  Use pip3.4 to install numpy, 
Pillow and Pmw.   Follow installation guides from 
www.python.org.  Python3.4 will be installed in
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/

It is important that references to python should then be
to python3.4 and not the earlier version of python.  Watch
out for Apple's use of soft links to the earlier versions
found in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework. These
should be disabled.

You will also need portaudio v19 as well as fftw libraries
from www.portaudio.org and www.fftw.org respectively.  

Then, in the wspr directory:

configure --with-portaudio-include-dir=/usr/local/include \
  --with-portaudio-lib-dir=/usr/local/lib

Check the new Makefile carefully to see that the correct
references to python3.4 and the new f2py are made. Then

   make

You might have to move Audio.so to WsjtMod manually.

Thereafter     python wspr.py   should execute.
