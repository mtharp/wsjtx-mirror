Installation Instructions for WSPR 4.0
--------------------------------------

The following is a brief installation guide using Linux as the example. WSPR
can be built on Windows (using MinGW+MSYS / JTSDK-PY), and on Mac OSX 10.6/7
using the repsective Makefile.


BASIC LINUX INSTRUCTIONS: (Linux Example x86_64 System):
-----------------------------------------------------------
To compile WSPR, as a minimum, you will need the following:

	* A C, C++ and gfortran compiler.
	  The GNU Tool chaines tested: 4.8.1/2. 4.9.x has not been tested
	* GNU Autotools: autoconf, make, libtool
	* Portaudio-19
	* FFTW 3.3+
	* Samplerate Library.
	* Python3.2+
	* Numeric Python (F2PY-3.2+)
	* PIL, (Python Imaging Library)
	* Tcl\TK (8.6.1 or Later)
	* Hamlib 1.2.15.3+ (If rig control is desired)

NOTE: Where possible, install dev / header packages.

The default install location is /usr/local, however, you can run WSPR
from the source tree after make. You can also change the install target
locaiton using the following configure parameter:

--prefix=/desired/install/path

You will also need a paths to Portaudio Libs and Lib-Dir if not picked up
by the configure script:

--with-portaudio-lib-dir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
--with-portaudio-include-dir=/usr/include

On dual Python systems, you need to specify Python3+ and F2PY3+ locations:

PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
F2PY=/usr/local/bin/f2py3

To see a full list of options,use: ./configure --help


CONFIGURE && MAKE (x86_64 *Nix System)
--------------------------------------

	autoconf
	./configure --with-portaudio-lib-dir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu \
	--with-portaudio-include-dir=/usr/include \
	PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3 \
	F2PY=/usr/local/bin/f2py3
	

At this point, you can run WSPR from the source tree with:

python3 -O wspr.py


FINAL MAKE INSTALL
------------------

To install WSPR into system directories (for all users)

Note: you need root or RootSudo for this step:

sudo make install

or

root make install


CLEAN BUILD TREE:
-----------------
make clean

CLEAN FOR DISTRIBUTION:
-----------------------
make distclean


BASIC MAC OSX INSTALLATION INSTUCTIONS (Example 10.7)
-----------------------------------------------------

You need to be familiar with command line operations using
the Terminal window and with downloading and installing
libraries.

Apple provide python 2.x as part of the system but this must
be upgraded to python 3.4.  Use pip3.4 to install numpy, 
Pillow and Pmw.   Follow installation guides from 
www.python.org.  Python3.4 will be installed in
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/

It is important that references to python should then be
to python3.4 and not the earlier version of python.  Watch
out for Apple's use of soft links to the earlier versions
found in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework.   These
should be disabled.

You will also need portaudio v19 as well as fftw libraries
from www.portaudio.org and www.fftw.org respectively.  

Then, in the wspr directory:

configure --with-portaudio-include-dir=/usr/local/include \
  --with-portaudio-lib-dir=/usr/local/lib

Check the new Makefile carefully to see that the correct
references to python3.4 and the new f2py are made. Then

   make

You might have to move Audio.so to WsjtMod manually.

Thereafter     python wspr.py   should execute.
