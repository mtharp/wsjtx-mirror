Current Development Version: JTSDK-NIX

2014-04-05 Greg Beam <ki7mt@yahoo.com>

* Updated pkg_list_ubuntu x86 & x86_64
* Now using repo package of python3-numpy
* Default install location for f2py3 is /usr/bin
* Still seeing: #defining NPY_NO_DEPRECATED_API NPY_1_7_API_VERSION
  warnings. Not sure if this is a Ubuntu config or Numpy issue.
  It does not seem to bother WSPR or WSJT
* Using the standard distro install is the best way to go if at
  all possible.
* For now, build_numpy is commented out in jtsdk-nix/setup.sh. Will
* leave build_numpy in /functions as other distro's may make use of it.
* From a fresh Ubuntu 14.04 install, all went without error. Building of
  WSPR (current SVN) was 100%, only a few unused var messages. No errors

* Removed build_pa function, no longer needed.
* Updated setup.sh to remove build_pa
* JTSDK-NIX now buildws WSJT-X, WSJT and WSPR on Ubuntu 14.04
* WSJT configure.ac and Makefile.in needs updating to find
  portaudio properly.
